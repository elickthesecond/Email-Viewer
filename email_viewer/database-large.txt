The 44th DAC provides a unique opportunity
Gabe Moretti, editor

The Automotive Electronics theme of next year's conference in San Diego provides opportunities for a more varied technical program than in previous
year.  Not only are disciplines like PC Board design and FPGA based systems very important in automotive applications, but cabling and
hardware/software co-development also play a major role in the development of automotive electronics systems.  In addition, the rapid changes in
automotive design, due principally to the need to improve fuel conservation and to limit the impact of cars on global warming, are giving raise to
new opportunities to the EDA and electronics industry.  Integrating an electronic assembly into an automotive system, being it the engine, the
brakes, or the collision avoidance system, provides truly system level problems that require thinking and working at a higher level of abstraction in
a manner the EDA industry has never faced.  It would be very exciting to hear papers and panel contributions from professionals outside of our
industry.  Their contribution may offer new insights into market segments we already serve or provide a look at markets we should expand into. 
Whatever your expectations, I predict an exciting and different DAC than any before: one not to be missed.

EDA, where the modern automobile begins
By Gabe Moretti

Mankind's love for the automobile is well known, and it is one of the few things that transcends nationality, age, and sex.  Thanks to the
advancements in electronics the automobile has undergone a profound transformation in recent years, and more changes are coming.  The modern
automobile is a product of the EDA industry.  Without electronic design automation it would not be possible to design and manufacture the most vital
parts of the modern car, let alone those functions that we are growing to take for granted that allow us to communicate, navigate, and drive in
comfort and safety.

It makes sense, therefore, that the next DAC should choose automotive electronics as its theme.  Dennis Brophy, director of strategic business
development at Mentor Graphics, is the New Initiatives Chair and is thus responsible for fostering the theme of the 44th DAC.  Although at first
blush some people may be puzzled by the theme, Dennis thinks that it is an indicator of how accustomed we have grown to the sophistication of our
automobile, to the point that most people do not realize that there are 31 microprocessors and microcontrollers in the average car.  Mr. Brophy then
goes into much more detail stating: "There has been considerable growth in the complexity of automobile electronics.  There has also been the rapid
increase of mechatronic (electro-mechanical) sub-systems included in the electronics architecture of modern vehicles as well. The Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) describes mechatronics as 'the synergetic integration of mechanical engineering with electronic and
intelligent computer control in the design and manufacture of industrial products and processes.' (see
http://www.elabs3.com/ct.html?rtr=on&s=ejn,r1um,xd4,2f9x,id46,2kto,4855 )  Combining sensors, actuators, electronic control units (ECU) and the
network that links them, the design of mechatronic systems bridges across multiple engineering disciplines, requires resolution of complex problems
interwoven among hardware, software, control, mechanical and electrical engineering domains.  Several of these disciplines intersect at the Design
Automation Conference that makes this venue an excellent location to discuss the complexity of design for automotive systems. 

With continued growth in automotive electronic applications and expansion of consumer choice are together creating a serious complexity challenge for
design teams. As complexity is the common thread among the problems designers must overcome while striving to reach competing goals, design teams need
to effectively manage it.  The traditional complexity of chip design which is a DAC stalwart will include complexity of automotive electronics in its
many forms."

Some of the most demanding electronic systems in your car are those you will never see and, hopefully, never have to worry about.  I am speaking of
the engine control system that determines and measures the fuel mixture and calculates the timing of the ignition of the fuel in the cylinders to
maximize power output and minimize consumption and pollution.  

Whether you are driving an automatic car, a sport car with semi-automatic gear shifts, or you are fortunate enough to be driving a high-end sport car
with sequential gear shift, you have electronics to thank for its smooth operation.  The most important thing after being able to move in the
direction you desire, and some -- people would argue even more important-- is the ability to brake.  Here too electronics help insure a safe and
reliable operation with anti-skid and anti-lock functions.  And, of course, we all know about air bags, the ones in the car I mean.  A sophisticated
climate control system keeps the occupants comfortable, an entertainment system most people would like to have in their homes dispels the commuting
boredom, a navigation system insures that we no longer have to fight to unfold a map while steering with our knees, and a bluetooth communication
system allows us to talk with the rest of the world while we are in transit from one stop to the next in our busy lives.  Fans of Formula1, or F1 as
its fans call it, can see either the Intel or the AMD logo on the cars of the top performing teams.  At the 2004 US Grand Prix at Indianapolis I was
a guest of the Williams/BMW team courtesy of Xilinx whose FPGAs are an integral part of the car's engine control unit.  Now of course BMW has its own
factory team and Williams uses another manufacturer's engines ñ but that is a different article.

The automobile is also a very egalitarian platform that requires the skills of IC, FPGA, and board designers.  In fact, it is a place where cable and
harness developers can truly claim that if it was not for their expertise, the rest of the electronic systems would not work.  If we just focused on
what is already widely available we could fill the technical program and the exhibit hall.  But, like every other piece of high technology, there is
much more to come.  Collision avoidance is an application area that is attracting a lot of interest lately with the need for RF, analog/mixed signal,
digital, and even antenna design.  Automobile manufacturers have used system level design well before our industry coined the ESL moniker, and
hardware/software co-design is a necessity in their application domain.  The automobile is also the most important platform for the development of
batteries and electrical motors for both hybrid and electric propulsion.  Living in Florida I often wonder what obstacles exist to recharging the
batteries of these types of cars through solar power, since on average, they spend a lot of time in parking lots being warmed by the sun.

The DAC has at times, and I am guilty of this, been accused of being too IC centric, giving short shrift to PC board and FPGA designers.  The 44th
DAC does provide an unprecedented opportunity to submit papers to the technical program and panels to the panels committee on these subjects and
more, like cables design, hardware/software co-development, and even electro/mechanical system design and integration.  At the 2005 DATE conference
in Paris, Mentor had a racing game in its booth, complete with a chassis and bodywork of an F1 BMW, to highlight the contributions that its various
products make to the development and functioning of a competitive racing machine.  Of course it was just a mockup: it takes the body of a most
athletic jockey to fit in the cockpit of the real thing!  F1 is one of the few sports where being tall is a disadvantage.  But even without a F1
machine, there is plenty of opportunity to show how EDA companies are contributing to the advancement of the automotive industry, and for the leaders
of the industry to glimpse opportunities to expand the industry into new market sectors.

Subject: Inviting you to participate in WMSCI 2007
Date: 7 Oct 2006 23:43:09
Message:

Dear Donald Yeung:

We invite you to submit a paper/abstract to the 11th World Multi-Conference
on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics
(http://www.iiis-cyber.org/wmsci2007). IT will take place in Orlando,
Florida, USA, from July 8-11, 2007.

We are emphasizing the area of Information Systems, mainly Geographical
Information Systems which, we think, are related to your specific academic
or professional area.

All submitted papers will have an extensive reviewing process. A
multi-methodological review will be applied in the selection process of
this multi-disciplinary conference. Submitted papers or extended abstracts
will have three kinds of reviews: double-blind (by at least three
reviewers), non-blind, and participative peer-to-peer review. These three
reviews will support the selection process of those that will be accepted
for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected
for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details are given in the conference
web site.

Of the papers presented, the best 10%-20% of the papers will be published
in Volume 6 of JSCI Journal (www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI) and sent free to
over 200 university and research libraries

Also, we would like to invite you to organize an invited session related to
a topic of your research interest. If you are interested in organizing an
invited session, please, fill out the respective form provided in the
conference web page. We will send you a password, so you can include and
modify papers in your invited session.

More details about the reviewing process, organizing invited sessions and
submissions deadlines can be found at our web site.
(http://www.iiis-cyber.org/wmsci2007)

If the deadlines are tight and you need more time, let us know about a
suitable time for you and I will inform you if it is feasible for us.

Again, we invite you to participate in the 11th World Multi-Conference on
Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics which in the past has had
participants from over 80 countries.

Best regards,

Professor Nagib Callaos
WMSCI 2007 General Chair

Workshop on EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
Part of ACM FCRC, San Diego, 13-14 June 2007

http://www.expcs.org


Call for Papers

This is not a conventional "systems" conference in computer science!
First, it takes a broad view including both software and hardware
systems, networking, applications, software engineering, and even theory.
Second, the focus is on the experimental approach to doing research.
High-quality papers are solicited on the
nine themes identified below. In particular, we proactively encourage
papers that advance the methodological aspects of experimental
computer science, or present new real-world data and observations
about computer systems and use. A major criterion for acceptance will be that
the paper contributes to the discourse on the subject; it does not
have to be the definitive final word on it.

* Experimental engineering:
  techniques, insights, and understanding that come from building and
  using computer systems, and discovering behavior that emerges from
  the inherent complexity of working systems.

* Measurements and metrics:
  what to measure, how to achieve reliable measurements in face of
  noise and errors, and what metrics will turn raw
  measurements into useful information.

* Experimental methodology:
  best practices that should be followed, and pitfalls that need to
  be avoided.

* Tools of the trade:
  measurement tools that support sound instrumentation, tools for
  automatic flagging of anomalous conditions, and tools for automatic
  management of experiments.

* Explanation and hypothesis testing:
  the study of complex systems, with the goal of achieving
  a deeper understanding of why they behave in the way they do.

* Reproducibility:
  reproducing previous results, the scope to which they pertain, and
  factors that affect them.

* Data collection and data manipulation:
  reports on collecting and using data, including issues like
  anonymization and sanitization.

* Theory and practice:
  cases where theory leads to hypotheses that can be checked
  experimentally, and cases where experimentation questions
  assumptions used as a basis for theory.

* Education and an experimental culture:
  the need for a cultural change in order to make the experimental
  approach more prevalent, and development of courses and curricular material.

In the interest of reproducibility and advancing the state of the art,
it is highly desirable that papers be accompanied by software and data
sets used in the experiments.

Measurement Challenge

In addition to contributed papers, we are planning to have a session
devoted to a common measurement challenge, where participants present
(and discuss) how they approached a given problem.
The challenge this year is to measure the indirect overhead of a
context switch, i.e. the degradation in performance due to
perturbation of cache state.
This is non-trivial, as it obviously this depends on myriad details
including workload behavior and architecture.
To participate, submit a report of your approach and results by the
paper submittal deadline.
Selected reports will be included in the proceedings.

Roundtable on Experimentation in Computer Science Education

Experimentation and empirical data seem to be all but absent from
current computer science curricula.
We are planning to hold a roundtable on this issue, with emphasis on
operational ways to advance experimentation in computer science
education, including the design of complete courses, how to add
experimentation into existing courses, and ideas for term projects.

To participate, submit a position paper by the paper submittal deadline.
A joint paper summarizing the roundtable will be included in the proceedings.

Message:

Dear Yeung Donald:

We invite you to submit a paper/abstract to the 11th World Multi-Conference
on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics
(http://www.iiis-cyber.org/wmsci2007). IT will take place in Orlando,
Florida, USA, from July 8-11, 2007.

We are emphasizing the area of Software Engineering which, we think, is
related to your specific academic or professional area.

All submitted papers will have an extensive reviewing process. A
multi-methodological review will be applied in the selection process of
this multi-disciplinary conference. Submitted papers or extended abstracts
will have three kinds of reviews: double-blind (by at least three
reviewers), non-blind, and participative peer-to-peer review. These three
reviews will support the selection process of those that will be accepted
for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected
for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details are given in the conference
web site.

Of the papers presented, the best 10%-20% of the papers will be published
in Volume 6 of JSCI Journal (www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI) and sent free to
over 200 university and research libraries

Also, we would like to invite you to organize an invited session related to
a topic of your research interest. If you are interested in organizing an
invited session, please, fill out the respective form provided in the
conference web page. We will send you a password, so you can include and
modify papers in your invited session.

More details about the reviewing process, organizing invited sessions and
submissions deadlines can be found at our web site.
(http://www.iiis-cyber.org/wmsci2007)

If the deadlines are tight and you need more time, let us know about a
suitable time for you and I will inform you if it is feasible for us.

Again, we invite you to participate in the 11th World Multi-Conference on
Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics which in the past has had
participants from over 80 countries.

Best regards,

Professor Nagib Callaos
WMSCI 2007 General Chair

SC Global Satellite and SC Desktop Registration Deadline is October 31
>From its successful debut last year, SCDesktop returns to bring SC06 to "virtual attendees."  As a Virtual Attendee you will have access to:

	- Keynote
	- Plenary Sessions
	- Masterworks Sessions
	- Exhibitor Forums
	- Poster Sessions
	- SC Global Sessions

Virtual Attendees will access the above sessions via collaborative technologies that provide two-way audio and video connections to the conference. Attendees will receive a limited or open source license for the collaboration software. Testing and training will be provided so that attendees can successfully participate.

An added feature of SCDesktop this year is the introduction of Time Delayed Broadcasting. All programs that are offered to our virtual attendees will be broadcast again twelve (12) hours later. This time delay will allow our European and Asian audience to enjoy the programs at a more convenient time.
More information: http://sc06.supercomp.org/conference/scglobal
Questions: scglobal@sc06.supercomputing.org

Get Ready for Scatter/Gather "Unconference" Experience 
Scatter/Gather's objective is to stimulate a very open dialog of new ideas and emerging work.  This year we'll modify the format a bit to more closely resemble an "unconference" in which the meeting is driven and created dynamically by the participants.  We'll use a whiteboard to self-organize, so look for the sign-up display at the conference near the registration area.  Time-slots for the sessions on Tuesday, November 14 at 3:30 p.m. and Thursday, Nov. 16, 10:30 a.m. are limited.  The policy is first-come, first-served.  

Remember, the idea is to share and get feedback on your ideas, not make a polished presentation!

<b class="subhed">Get Ready for Scatter/Gather "Unconference" Experience</b><br>
Scatter/Gather's objective is to stimulate a very open dialog of new ideas and emerging work.  This year we'll modify the format a bit to more closely resemble an "unconference" in which the meeting is driven and created dynamically by the participants.  We'll use a whiteboard to self-organize, so look for the sign-up display at the conference near the registration area.  Time-slots for the sessions on Tuesday, November 14 at 3:30 p.m. and Thursday, Nov. 16, 10:30 a.m. are limited.  The policy is first-come, first-served.  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Remember, the idea is to share and get feedback on your ideas, not make a polished presentation!

* ASPLOS 2006 Call for Participation

ASPLOS XII, Oct. 21 through 25, 2006, San Jose, CA

                           Call for Participation

The ASPLOS XII organizing committee is pleased to announce the ASPLOS
XII conference to be held in San Jose, CA from Oct. 21st to 25th
2006. ASPLOS is a multi-disciplinary conference that seeks
cross-fertilizing research in areas of hardware, architecture,
compilers, operating systems, networking, and applications. ASPLOS
provides a high quality forum for scientists and engineers to present
their latest research findings in these rapidly changing fields. It
has captured some of the major computer systems innovations of the
past two decades (e.g., RISC and VLIW processors, small and
large-scale multiprocessors, clusters and networks-of-workstations,
optimizing compilers, RAID, and network-storage system designs).
Today multi-disciplinary research is becoming even more important, as
boundaries between hardware/software and local/network computing
blur, as the form and capabilities of computing devices becomes ever
more varied, and as the user-base and applications expand
exponentially. In addition to the main program, this upcoming ASPLOS
will offer several tutorials and workshops on a variety of focus
areas.
                                 Tutorials

T1: Innovating with OpenSPARC

 *  Time: Saturday Oct 21, 9:00am-12:15pm
 *  Organizers:  David Weaver and Shrenik Mehta, Sun Microsystems
    Inc.
 *  Abstract: OpenSPARC T1 is the world's first 64-bit, 32-thread,
    open-source hardware design -- freely available under the GNU
    Public License (GPL).   It provides an unprecedented research
    vehicle and a highly-threaded, reconfigurable microprocessor
    design from which custom variants can quickly be designed.   With
    today's complex microprocessors taking years of elapsed time and
    tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, OpenSPARC T1
    provides a starting point that allows developers and researchers
    to stand on the shoulders of a proven, verified, high-performance
    design, shortening time-to-market, and dramatically lowering
    development costs.

    This tutorial will provide the background for building systems
    and software using the OpenSPARC design.  Members of the
    OpenSPARC T1 development team will present an introduction to
    OpenSPARC T1, including: 
 *  Overview of OpenSPARC processor architecture (changes since SPARC
    V9) and OpenSPARC T1 microarchitecture (processor organization,
    pipeline, threading model)
 *  SAM-T1 simulation tools for OpenSPARC (architecture model,
    full-system simulation platform, device models, device driver
    development, trace generation, user interface, etc)
 *  Virtualization on OpenSPARC: Porting /your/ operating system on
    top of the Hypervisor
 *  Maximizing the benefits of CMT with CoolTool development tools
    (compilers, GCC, etc)
 *  Creating optimal SPARC executables using the Automated Tuning
    System (ATS) 

An overview of OpenSPARC T1 can be found at http://OpenSPARC.net .

T2: A Deep-Submicron CMOS Primer

 *  Time: Saturday Oct 21, 2:pm-5:00pm
 *  Organizers:  J. Adam Butts, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
 *  Abstract: This tutorial will survey the physical implementation
    of CMOS circuitry with particular attention to the constraints
    and non-idealitites of the sub-100nm regime.  Topics will include
    transistor and interconnect scaling, leakage mechanisms, power
    dissipation, reliability, variability, and yield.  As the
    influence of these issues on circuit design increases, their
    effects must be accounted for earlier in the design process.  The
    rising prevalence of some of these topics at ASPLOS illustrates
    this point.  This tutorial will explain the origins of these
    trends in the technology and connect them with their
    architectural consequences, allowing participants to better
    participate in the new research directions that are arising as a
    result.

T3: Enterprise Power and Cooling: A Chip-to-Data-Center Perspective

 *  Time: Sunday Oct 22, 8:30am-12:00pm
 *  Organizers:
     +  Chandrakant D. Patel, Hewlett Packard Labs
     +  Parthasarathy Ranganathan, Hewlett Packard Labs
 *  Abstract: Power and cooling are increasingly becoming key
    challenges in enterprise environments, impacting infrastructure,
    electricity, and maintenance costs, as well as compaction,
    reliability, and environmental standards' compliance. In the
    future, it is going to be important to address these challenges
    "holistically" - across the different levels of the hardware and
    software stacks while considering the total cost of ownership
    (TCO). For example, power and cooling need to be considered
    together along with performance and reliability, as decisions
    made for one influence the choices and costs for the other.
    Similarly, there is a need for cross-cutting solutions going
    beyond better adaptivity in the system elements to include the
    operating system and the management and applications software
    stack. Co-ordination is also needed across the entire "ensemble"
    - from chips to data centers. All this will require
    interdisciplinary research spanning electrical engineering,
    computer science, and thermal science. In aid of this, our
    tutorial seeks to provide a broad overview of the power and
    cooling problem in enterprises. We present recent industry trends
    to motivate the problem and then discuss current cooling and
    power work in the context of a unified framework from chip-core
    to data center. We conclude with a discussion of holistic
    optimizations for the problem including a detailed case study of
    the HP Labs Smart Data Center.

T4: Using Systemsim to Guide Application Transformation and Tuning
for the Cell Broadband Engine

 *  Time: Sunday Oct 22, 1:30pm-5:00pm
 *  Organizers:
     +  Patrick Bohrer
     +  Vipin Sachdeva
     +  Mike Kistler
     +  Jim Peterson
     +  Dave Murrell, all IBM
 *  Abstract: The Cell Broadband Engine SDK embodies a programming
    environment featuring an assortment of mechanisms to accelerate
    application performance. Parallel programming constructs, vector
    SIMD operations, and DMA scatter/gather capabilities are all
    supported by this freely available IBM Alphaworks offering
    (http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/cellsw). In order to take
    full advantage of the CBE platform performance potential, cell
    software developers typically need to re-structure their
    applications to incorporate the SDK programming paradigms. The
    Systemsim Cell simulator furnishes an array of instrumentation
    and displays that are valuable for gaining insight into
    application characteristics and system behavior.

    The focus of this tutorial is to introduce Systemsim performance
    analysis features used to guide the process of converting a
    scalar application into a parallel SIMD version controlled by the
    PPE and accelerated by SPEs. A demonstration of this process will
    be given for a sample vectorizable application. At each step
    along the transformation, we will present Systemsim measurement
    capture and visualization facilities, and explain how to
    interpret the resulting data to guide trade-off decisions. Some
    techniques and tools which assist in balancing computation with
    DMA data movement will also be introduced.

    Although the tutorial will include a brief overview of the CBE
    architecture and the SDK components, exposure to the Cell
    Broadband Engine architecture and familiarity with the SDK
    sufficient to compile and run applications on Systemsim is
    assumed.

T5: Intel Virtualization Technology (VT): Motivation and Architecture

 *  Time: Sunday Oct 22, 1:30pm-5:00pm
 *  Organizers:
     +  Richard Uhlig, Intel
     +  Gil Neiger, Intel
 *  Abstract: In this tutorial we examine aspects of the IA-32
    instruction-set architecture (ISA) that complicate the
    implementation of virtual machine monitors (VMMs) for Intel-based
    platforms.  We then introduce Intel VT, an extension to the IA-32
    system ISA that addresses these challenges, and simplifies the
    design of IA-32 VMMs.  The tutorial will include a detailed
    overview of the various architectural features of VT, and explain
    how they can be used to build a VMM for IA-based systems.

* CACTI release 4.0, updates include leakage power modeling

CACTI is an integrated cache access time, cycle time, area, and power
model for use by computer architects. CACTI 4.0 adds a leakage power
model and updates the basic circuit structures and device parameters to
better reflect recent advances in semiconductor scaling. CACTI 4.0 also
adds support for greater parameterization, such as user defined tag and
data widths, a serial tag and data access option for low power, and
modeling of memory structures without tags.  A tech report on CACTI 4.0
is available at http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2006/HPL-2006-86.html.
A graphical web interface has also been added to make CACTI accessible
to a larger user community. The web interface can be accessed at
http://quid.hpl.hp.com:9081/cacti/. The web interface should meet the
needs of most CACTI users. For users that need to modify CACTI or
integrate it into other tools to support their research, CACTI 4.0
source code can be obtained at
http://web.hpl.hp.com/personal/Norman_Jouppi/cacti4.html.  CACTI 4.0 was
developed by David Tarjan, Shyam Thoziyoor, and Norm Jouppi.

********************************************************************************
                                CALL FOR PAPERS

         First Workshop on Statistical and Machine learning approaches 
                     applied to ARchitectures and compilaTion
                                  (SMART '07)
                     http://www.hipeac.net/smart-workshop.html 

                        January 28, 2007, Ghent, Belgium

                    (co-located with HiPEAC 2007 Conference)

********************************************************************************


The rapid rate of architectural change has placed enormous stress on compiler 
writers to keep pace with microprocessor evolution.  This problem is 
compounded by the current trend to have multi-cores and multi-threading which 
makes such systems increasingly difficult to target.  Also,  current methods 
of designing computer systems will no longer be feasible in 10-15 years time; 
what is needed are new innovative approaches to architecture design that scale 
both with advances in underlying technology and with future application domains.

In recent years, several papers have been published showing great potential in 
constructing compilers and architectures using approaches such as machine 
learning and search.

The purpose of this workshop is to promote new ideas and to present recent 
developments in compiler and architecture design using machine learning, 
statistical approaches, and search in order to enhance their performance, 
scalability, and adaptability. 

Topics of Interest (but not limited to):  

Machine Learning, Statistical Approaches, or Search applied to 

* Feedback-Directed Compilation 
* Iterative Compilation 
* Dynamic Compilation/Adaptive Execution 
* Parallel Compiler Optimizations 
* Low-power Optimizations 
* Simulation 
* Performance Models 
* Processor and System Architecture 
* Design Space Exploration 
* Other Topics relevant to Intelligent and Adaptive Compilers/Architectures  

**** Paper Submission Guidelines ****

We invite two kinds papers: 

* Research papers with new results (15 page limit)
* Short position/experience papers  (5 page limit) 

NOTE: Important ammendment to publication procedure:

In order to increase the importance of this workshop, we will host all 
accepted papers on the workshop website.

Papers must be submitted in PDF (preferably) or postscript formats. 
Papers can be submitted on the website or can be emailed directly to
jcavazos@inf.ed.ac.uk.  We suggest to use LNCS LaTeX templates that 
can be found at http://www.springeronline.com/lncs (go to "For Authors" 
and then "Information for LNCS Editors/Authors")
 
Proceedings:  
An informal collection of the papers to be presented will be distributed at 
the workshop. 

Questions regarding the workshop should be forwarded to jcavazos@inf.ed.ac.uk.  

****  Important Dates ****

CONFERENCE DETAILS

ANCS is a research conference that focuses on the design of the
hardware and software components used to create modern communication
networks. The combination of increasing network line speeds and
expanding functional requirements pose continuing and growing
challenges for system designers. New technology elements, including
network processors, content addressable memories, configurable logic
and special-purpose components offer new opportunities for meeting
these challenges, but also raise a variety of new issues. ANCS focuses
on architectures for networking and communication in the broad sense,
including novel architectures, architectural support for advanced
communication, algorithms and protocols for advanced architectures,
software and applications for next-generation networking
architectures, and methodology and benchmarking for evaluating
advanced communication architectures.

PROGRAM DETAILS

The program for ANCS 2006 includes:
* Two keynote talks
* Six sessions of technical papers
   * Switches & Routers
   * Lookups and Classification
   * Content Inspection
   * Packet Processing  Architectures
   * Scheduling
   * End-to-end Security

See the advance program at http://www.ancsconf.org

STUDENT TRAVEL GRANTS

CONFERENCE DETAILS

ANCS is a research conference that focuses on the design of the
hardware and software components used to create modern communication
networks. The combination of increasing network line speeds and
expanding functional requirements pose continuing and growing
challenges for system designers. New technology elements, including
network processors, content addressable memories, configurable logic
and special-purpose components offer new opportunities for meeting
these challenges, but also raise a variety of new issues. ANCS focuses
on architectures for networking and communication in the broad sense,
including novel architectures, architectural support for advanced
communication, algorithms and protocols for advanced architectures,
software and applications for next-generation networking
architectures, and methodology and benchmarking for evaluating
advanced communication architectures.

PROGRAM DETAILS

The program for ANCS 2006 includes:
* Two keynote talks
* Six sessions of technical papers
   * Switches & Routers
   * Lookups and Classification
   * Content Inspection
   * Packet Processing  Architectures
   * Scheduling
   * End-to-end Security

See the advance program at http://www.ancsconf.org

STUDENT TRAVEL GRANTS

Due to the generous support of the Computer and Information Science
and Engineering (CISE) directorate of the National Science Foundation,
we are pleased to offer a limited number of awards supporting travel
by students to ANCS. Attendees from traditionally under-represented
groups are particularly encouraged to apply.

********************************************************************************
                                CALL FOR PAPERS

         First Workshop on Statistical and Machine learning approaches 
                     applied to ARchitectures and compilaTion
                                  (SMART '07)
                     http://www.hipeac.net/smart-workshop.html 

                        January 28, 2007, Ghent, Belgium

                    (co-located with HiPEAC 2007 Conference)

********************************************************************************


The rapid rate of architectural change has placed enormous stress on compiler 
writers to keep pace with microprocessor evolution.  This problem is 
compounded by the current trend to have multi-cores and multi-threading which 
makes such systems increasingly difficult to target.  Also,  current methods 
of designing computer systems will no longer be feasible in 10-15 years time; 
what is needed are new innovative approaches to architecture design that scale 
both with advances in underlying technology and with future application domains.

In recent years, several papers have been published showing great potential in 
constructing compilers and architectures using approaches such as machine 
learning and search.

The purpose of this workshop is to promote new ideas and to present recent 
developments in compiler and architecture design using machine learning, 
statistical approaches, and search in order to enhance their performance, 
scalability, and adaptability. 

Topics of Interest (but not limited to):  

Machine Learning, Statistical Approaches, or Search applied to 

* Feedback-Directed Compilation 
* Iterative Compilation 
* Dynamic Compilation/Adaptive Execution 
* Parallel Compiler Optimizations 
* Low-power Optimizations 
* Simulation 
* Performance Models 
* Processor and System Architecture 
* Design Space Exploration 
* Other Topics relevant to Intelligent and Adaptive Compilers/Architectures  

**** Paper Submission Guidelines ****

We invite two kinds papers: 

* Research papers with new results (15 page limit)
* Short position/experience papers  (5 page limit) 

NOTE: Important ammendment to publication procedure:

In order to increase the importance of this workshop, we will host all 
accepted papers on the workshop website.

Papers must be submitted in PDF (preferably) or postscript formats. 
Papers can be submitted on the website or can be emailed directly to
jcavazos@inf.ed.ac.uk.  We suggest to use LNCS LaTeX templates that 
can be found at http://www.springeronline.com/lncs (go to "For Authors" 
and then "Information for LNCS Editors/Authors")
 
Proceedings:  
An informal collection of the papers to be presented will be distributed at 
the workshop. 

Questions regarding the workshop should be forwarded to jcavazos@inf.ed.ac.uk.  

****  Important Dates ****

Dear Professor:
 
I will be back on the Maryland campus, to purchase textbooks, on Thursday, 
November 2. 
Our company buys recent/current editions of textbooks that faculty members 
are no longer using. We purchase student editions, duplications, 
annotated/instructor editions and review copies. These books are then made available to 
students at discounted prices.
Please contact me via return email if you have any books you would like to 
sell. If you would like to arrange for an alternate date or location, please let 
me know.
The following information will be very helpful to arrange a meeting and 
confirm a time.
 
The time (s) you are available
 
Your campus location if there is more than one
 
Your office location (office number and building name)
 
Office phone number or number where you can be reached
 
Thank You,
 
David Hanke

Title:  AFOSR Interests on Organic Photonics

By:  Dr. Charles YC Lee

Affiliation:  US Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Arlington,
Virginia
		       =20
Abstract:  The Organic Materials Chemistry Program at AFOSR has been
funding various organic materials for future Air Force applications.
The program includes photonic polymers, electronic polymers, materials
with controlled magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity and
other structural applications.  The photonic area includes second order
nonlinear optical materials and third order nonlinear optical materials,
liquid crystals for IR applications and photorefractive polymers.
Electronic properties of polymers are also covered in the area of solar
cells and thin film transistors.  New areas of controlling magnetic
permeability and dielectric permittivity, including negative index
materials, are also of interests.  An overview of the program will be
described.

Biography:  Charles Lee received a B.S. degree in Chemistry from Western
Illinois University in 1970, and a Ph. D. degree in Chemistry from
University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1976.  After spending time at
University of Southern California as a postdoctoral fellow, he joined
University of Dayton Research Institute in 1978.  In 1979, he joined the
Materials Laboratory of the Air Force as a research scientist,
conducting in house research in the Polymer Branch and the Composite
Branch, and managing roadmaps in various technology areas.  He moved to
Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) in 1991 and managed the
Polymer Chemistry Program and the Polymer Matrix Composite Program at
AFOSR.  He was awarded the Cleary Award for research in 1980 and was
elected as Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Fellow in 1999.

Dear Colleague,

Progressive Engineer, the online source for engineering-related  
directories and job openings, has posted a new feature story in its  
easy-to-read magazine section. It talks about Compatible Technology  
International, a group of volunteers consisting mostly of retired  
engineers that design basic food processing devices to help people in  
developing countries. These consist of hand-powered machines for  
tasks such as grinding fruit or turning peanuts into peanut butter in  
countries like Mali and Tanzania.

You can see this at http://www.ProgressiveEngineer.com

Looking for an engineering organization, association, or society?  
Check out the Directory of Resources for Engineers under Engineering  
Resources and Weblinks on our website.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom Gibson, P.E.

The Maryland Hybrid Networks Center (HyNet) would like to invite you to
attend the HyNet Colloquium on Friday, November 3, 2006 at 11:00 a.m. in
Room 1122 of the CSIC Building

The speaker will be Professor Alon Arlitsky of the University of California,
San Diego.   For further information, please see the following announcement:

Professor Alon Orlitsky

"Information Theory and Probability Estimation:
>From Shannon to Shakespeare via Laplace,
Good, Turing, Hardy, Ramanujan, and Fisher"

Joint work with Prasad Santhanam, Krishna Viswanathan, and Junan Zhang



Date:           Friday, November 3, 2006
Time:          11:00 a.m.
Location:    1122 CSIC Building
Host:           Prakash Narayan

Abstract:   Standard information-theoretic results show that data over
small, typically binary, alphabets can be compressed to Shannon's entropy
limit. Yet most practical sources, such as text, audio, or video, have
essentially infinite support. Compressing such sources requires estimating
probabilities of unlikely, even unseen, events, a problem considered by
Laplace. Of existing estimators, an ingenious if cryptic one derived by Good
and Turing while deciphering the Enigma code works best yet not optimally.
Hardy and Ramanujan's celebrated results on the number of integer partitions
yield an asymptotically optimal estimator that compresses arbitrary-alphabet
data patterns to their entropy. The same approach generalizes Fisher's
seminal work estimating the number of butterfly species and its extension
authenticating a poem purportedly written by The Bard. The talk covers these
topics and is self contained.

Bio:   Alon Orlitsky received B.Sc. degrees in Mathematics and Electrical
Engineering from Ben Gurion University in 1980 and 1981, and M.Sc. and Ph.D.
degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1982 and 1986.

>From 1986 to 1996 he was with the Communications Analysis Research
Department of Bell Laboratories. He spent the following year as a
quantitative analyst at D.E. Shaw and Company, an investment firm in New
York City.  In 1997 he joined the University of California, San Diego, where
he is currently a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of
Computer Science and Engineering.

Alon's research concerns information theory, learning, and speech
recognition. He is a recipient of the 1981 ITT International Fellowship and
of the 1992 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Paper Award, and a co-recipient of the 2006
IEEE Information Theory Paper Award.

Subject: Cooperative Localization in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks
Date: 30 Oct 2006 17:16:33

EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing

Special Issue on

Cooperative Localization in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks

Call for Papers

One of the major requirements for most applications based on wireless ad hoc and
sensor networks is accurate node localization. In fact, sensed data without position
information is often less useful.

Due to several factors (e.g., cost, size, power), only a small fraction of nodes obtain
the position information of the anchor nodes. In this case, a node has to estimate its
position without a direct interaction with anchor nodes and a cooperation between nodes
is needed in a multihop fashion. In some applications, none of the nodes are aware of
their absolute position (anchor-free) and only relative coordinates are estimated instead.

Most works reported in the literature have studied cooperative localization with the
emphasis on algorithms. However, very few works give emphasis on the localization as
estimation or on the investigation of fundamental performance limits as well as on
experimental activities. In particular, the fundamental performance limits of multihop
and anchor-free positioning in the presence of unreliable measurements are not yet well
established. The knowledge of such limits can also help in the design and comparison
of new low-complexity and distributed localization algorithms. Thus, measurement
campaigns in the context of cooperative localization to validate the algorithms as
well as to derive statistical models are very valuable.

The goal of this special issue is to bring together contributions from signal processing,
communications and related communities, with particular focus on signal processing,
new algorithm design methodologies, and fundamental limitations of cooperative localization
systems. Papers on the following and related topics are solicited:

o anchor-based and anchor-free distributed and cooperative localization algorithms
  that can cope with unreliable range measurements
o derivation of fundamental limits in multihop and anchor-free localization scenarios
o new localization algorithms design methodologies based, for example, on statistical
  inference and factor graphs
o low-complexity and energy-efficient distributed localization algorithms
o distributed ranging and time synchronization techniques
o measurement campaigns and statistical channel modeling
o algorithm convergence issues
o UWB systems
o localization through multiple-antenna systems
o experimental results

Authors should follow the EURASIP JASP manuscript format described at the journal

* SELSE-3 Call for Papers (Silicon Errors in Logic-System Effects)

                    Call for Papers
                        SELSE-3
         Silicon Errors in Logic - System Effects
                 April 3rd and 4th, 2007
                     Austin, Texas
                 http://www.selse.org

The growing complexity and shrinking geometries of modern device
technologies are making these high-density, low-voltage devices
increasingly susceptible to influences from electrical noise, process
variation, and natural radiation interference. System-level effects of
these errors can be far reaching. Growing concern about intermittent
errors, erratic storage cells, and the effects of aging are
influencing system design. This workshop provides a forum for
discussing current research and practices in system-level error
management. Participants from industry and academia explore both
current technologies and future research direction (including
nanotechnology). We are interested in soliciting papers that cover
system-level effects of errors from a variety of perspectives:
architectural, logical and circuit-level, and semiconductor
processes. Case studies are also solicited. 

Key areas of interest are (but not limited to):
* Technology trends and the impact on error rates. 
* New error mitigation techniques. 
* Characterizing the overhead and design complexity of error 
  mitigation techniques.  
* Case studies describing the engineering tradeoffs necessary to 
  decide what mitigation technique to apply. 
* Experimental data.
* System-level models: derating factors and validation of error
  models. 
* Error handling protocols (higher-level protocols for robust system
  design). 

Authors are requested to submit their extended abstracts for review
before December 20, 2006. Guidelines for submission are available at
www.selse.org. Submissions should be PDF or Microsoft Word files that
do not exceed four printed pages. Customary terms for copyright
agreement and non-confidentiality will apply. Authors will be notified
of paper outcome by March 2, 2007. The camera-ready formatted papers
are due on March 23, 2007.

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering
   of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing.  Many of the 24 joint conferences in
   WORLDCOMP are the premier conferences for presentation of
   advances in their respective fields.  We anticipate to have
   2000 or more attendees from over 75 countries participating in
   the 2007 joint conferences.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a
   common place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a
   forum for exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that
   interact.  The model used to form these annual conferences
   facilitates communication among researchers from all over the world
   in different fields of computer science, computer engineering and
   applied computing.  Both inward research (core areas of computer
   science and engineering) and outward research (multi-disciplinary,
   inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be covered during the
   conferences.

Proposal for Organizing Sessions/Workshops:

   Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from
   different authors (12 papers in the case of workshops).
   The session chairs will be responsible for all aspects of
   their sessions; including, soliciting papers, reviewing,
   selecting, ...  The names of session chairs will appear as
   Associate Editors in the conference proceedings and on the
   cover of the books.

   Proposals to organize sessions should include the following
   information: name and address (+ email) of proposer, title of
   session, a 100-word description of the topic of the session,
   the name of the conference the session is submitted for
   consideration, and a short description on how the session will
   be advertised (in most cases, session proposers solicit papers
   from colleagues and researchers whose work is known to the
   session proposer).  E-mail your proposal to H. R. Arabnia
   (address is given above).  We would like to receive the
   proposals by December 1, 2006.

Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft paper
   (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 20, 2007. E-mail submissions in MS
   document or PDF formats are preferable (Fax or postal
   submissions are also fine.)  All reasonable typesetting formats
   are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will be
   asked to follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their
   papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
   limited to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been
   previously published or currently submitted for publication
   elsewhere.  The first page of the draft paper should include:
   title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, email
   address, and telephone number for each author.  The first page
   should also identify the name of the author who will be presenting
   the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that
   would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally, the name
   of the conference that the paper is being submitted to must be
   stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance,
   clarity, impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by
   two experts in the field who are independent of the conference
   program committee.  The referees' evaluations will then be reviewed
   by two members of the program committee who will recommend a
   decision to the chair of the track that the paper has been
   submitted to.  The chair will make the final decision.  Lastly, the
   Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one member of the program
   committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World
   Academy of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific
   computing; artificial intelligence; imaging science; databases;
   simulation; software engineering; embedded systems; internet
   and web technologies; communications; computer security; and
   bioinformatics.) The Program Committee for individual
   conferences is currently being formed.  Those interested in
   joining the Program Committee should email H. R. Arabnia
   (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation
   and position, complete mailing address, email address, tel/fax
   numbers, a short biography together with research interests and
   the name of the conference offering to help with.

Location of Conferences:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort hotel,
   Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by
   hotels).  The Monte Carlo Resort is a mega hotel with excellent
   conference facilities and over 3,000 rooms.  The hotel is
   minutes from the airport with 24-hour shuttle service to and
   from the airport.  This hotel has many recreational attractions,
   including: waterfalls, spa, pools and kiddie pools, sunning
   decks, Easy River water ride, wave pool with cascades, lighted
   tennis courts, health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool,
   sauna, ...), arcade game rooms, nightly shows, snack bars, a
   number of restaurants, shopping area, bars, ...  Many of these
   attractions are open 24 hours a day and most are suitable for
   families and children.  The negotiated room rate for conference
   attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within walking
   distance from most other attractions (major shopping areas,
   recreational destinations, fine dining and night clubs, free
   street shows, Golf courses...).

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION: RAAW 2006 in conjunction with MICRO-39
Sunday Dec 10th,  Orlando, Florida,
Walt Disney World Swan Hotel

Reconfigurable and Adaptive Architecture Workshop  (RAAW 2006),  Held
in Conjunction with 39th International Conference on Microarchitecture
(MICRO-39)

Important Dates:
Hotel reservation cut-off date is Nov. 17, 2006 (Friday), 5 PM Eastern Time
Early registration: before Nov 21st, 2006

Workshop Theme

The tremendous advances in process technology provide architects and
microarchitects with many interesting opportunities for making use of
the huge transistor budget to enhance performance and increase
throughput. However, the complexity of software applications and
system software presents a challenging problem. The varying
requirements of the different applications running on a single
machine, as well as the changing behavior of a single application
during its lifetime, make choosing a suitable general purpose
architecture a big challenge. This raises the need for an architecture
that can adapt to the different requirements of the applications. The
power consumption limits and the growing importance of reliability
further add to the appeal of such adaptive architectures. Adaptive and
reconfigurable architectures are also becoming important in the
embedded systems area. The functionalities and the performance
requirements of embedded systems are increasing. However, the very low
energy consumption requirements of such systems have to be maintained.

The Reconfigurable and Adaptive Architecture Workshop provides a
high-quality forum for computer scientists and engineers to present
their latest research findings in the rapidly evolving field of
reconfigurable and adaptive architectures.

CONFERENCE DETAILS

ANCS is a research conference that focuses on the design of the
hardware and software components used to create modern communication
networks. The combination of increasing network line speeds and
expanding functional requirements pose continuing and growing
challenges for system designers. New technology elements, including
network processors, content addressable memories, configurable logic
and special-purpose components offer new opportunities for meeting
these challenges, but also raise a variety of new issues. ANCS focuses
on architectures for networking and communication in the broad sense,
including novel architectures, architectural support for advanced
communication, algorithms and protocols for advanced architectures,
software and applications for next-generation networking
architectures, and methodology and benchmarking for evaluating
advanced communication architectures.

PROGRAM DETAILS

The program for ANCS 2006 includes:
* Two keynote talks
* Six sessions of technical papers
   * Switches & Routers
   * Lookups and Classification
   * Content Inspection
   * Packet Processing  Architectures
   * Scheduling
   * End-to-end Security

See the advance program at http://www.ancsconf.org

STUDENT TRAVEL GRANTS

Due to the generous support of the Computer and Information Science
and Engineering (CISE) directorate of the National Science Foundation,
we are pleased to offer a limited number of awards supporting travel
by students to ANCS. Attendees from traditionally under-represented
groups are particularly encouraged to apply.

                         on Sunday, February 11, 2007


                  http://www.elis.ugent.be/~leeckhou/caecw10/

*******************************************************************************

The function of this workshop is the discussion of work-in-progress that
utilizes commercial workloads for the evaluation of computer architectures.
By discussing this ongoing research, the workshop will expose participants
to the characteristics of commercial workload behavior, provide an
understanding of how commercial workloads exercise computer systems and
potentially help establish methodologies for measuring, modeling and analyzing
the execution time characteristics of these workloads. 

Topics of interest include:
---------------------------

Traditional and emerging commercial workloads of interest
	-- Transaction processing, decision support, ERP, main memory and
	   streaming database servers 
	-- Multi-tier environments, including e-commerce, web servers and
	   application servers 
	-- Data mining and search engines 
	-- Managed runtime systems (e.g., Java virtual machines) 
	-- Storage system workloads 
	-- Streaming media workloads 
	-- XML-based workloads 

Workload analysis and characterization 
	-- Architecture-independent characterization of workloads 
	-- Impact of input data on workload behavior 
	-- Techniques for comparing workload behavior 
	-- Design and evaluation of synthetic workloads representative
	   of commercial workloads 
	-- Characterization of common components (packet processing,
	   XML processing, garbage collection, etc.) 

Systems architecture and design 
	-- Processor, cache, memory, I/O, or network subsystem design and
	   analysis using commercial workloads 
	-- System-level design and analysis of parallel or multiprocessor
	   servers, including blade servers 
	-- Benefits of multi-core architectures (homogeneous or heterogeneous) 
	-- Benefits of server consolidation (virtual machines) 
	-- Energy-efficiency of commercial workloads 
	-- Application and/or OS kernel algorithm improvements to enhance
	   performance 
	-- Independent validation of previously proposed work using commercial
	   workloads 

Evaluation techniques and methodologies 
	-- Simulation and analytical/statistical modeling techniques for
	   evaluating the performance of commercial workloads 
	-- Validations and comparisons of full-system simulators 
	-- Performance evaluation (hardware/software instrumentation) of
	   existing architectures using commercial workloads 
	-- Scalability considerations for commercial workloads 


Submission guidelines: 
----------------------

Interested authors are expected to submit a short paper (up to six pages)
by the submission deadline (see below) in pdf format to one of the workshop
organizers. Papers will be reviewed and accepted based on their novelty,
their relevance to the workshop and their technical merit. Authors of
accepted paper are expected to submit the final version of their short
paper (no more than six pages) by the final version deadline. A bound
proceedings will be distributed to the workshop attendees.  In addition,
accepted papers will be made available on the workshop's web site. Authors
of accepted papers are also expected to present their work during a 20-minute
talk.


Important dates:
-----------------
Paper submission deadline: EXTENDED to November 24, 2006
Notification of acceptance: December 15, 2006

EURASIP Journal on Embedded Systems

Special Issue on

Operating System Support for Embedded Real-Time Applications

Call for Papers

The rapid progress in processor and sensor technology combined with the expanding
diversity of applications fields is placing enormous demands on the facilities that
an embedded operating system must provide.

To offer these services, cosiderable effort has been made in research and development
on innovative real-time operating systems architectures and services. Designers and
developers of real-time operating systems have to consider many challenges arising
from two opposite axes: efficient resource usage (processor, memory, energy, network
bandwith, etc.) and dynamic configuration and adaptation (component-based development
and deployment, flexible scheduling, communications, etc.).

On the other hand, open source operating system development has been recognized as
a consolidated way to share experiences and as a consolidated way developments in
order to improve the quality and the reusability of the products. Currently, there
are several distributions for embedded systems based on Linux and other open source
developments.

This special issue focuses on new results of research work and development in the
field of real-time operating systems for embedded applications with special emphasis
on open source developments.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

o Innovative real-time operating system architectures for embedded systems
o Open components for embedded real-time applications
o Innovative tecniques in
  o scheduling
  o memory management
  o quality of service
  o communications
  o energy management
  o fault tolerance
o Multiprocessor embedded system support
o Hypervisor systems
o Hardware support for operating systems
o Security
o Real-time communication systems
o Power aware operating systems
o Open real-time Linux-based systems
o Case studies of open embedded real-time operating system developments
o Embedded application design

Subject: Faculty Self-Archiving Survey: Reminder
Date: 10 Nov 2006 09:32:06
Message:

Dear Professor Yeung,

This e-mail follows a previous letter sent to you October 20 and an e-mail message delivered October 27. We would greatly appreciate your taking 15 minutes to respond to a survey entitled 'Faculty Self-Archiving Behavior'. 

Definition: Self-archiving refers to depositing research and/or teaching materials on publicly accessible web sites, such as personal homepages, research project web sites, or open access repositories.

This dissertation study is funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and is being administered to faculty in select colleges and universities around the United States as part of a larger investigation into Institutional Repositories nationwide. A goal of the research is to better understand university faculty members' motivations for and perceived barriers to self-archiving their research and/or teaching materials. Self-archiving activities represent a major change in the way faculty disseminate scholarly content.  Therefore, your perceptions on self-archiving and methods that you use for this activity are critical. 

Here is a link to the survey:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?A=155587632E35436
If possible, please complete the online questionnaire by December 1.

Your participation is voluntary.  You may skip questions that make you uncomfortable and are free to withdraw at any point. Your responses will be used for research purposes only and will be kept in secure locations at the University of Michigan School of Information.  The information you provide in this survey will be kept confidential and responses will only be reported in aggregate form.  Furthermore, all personal information will be presented only in an aggregate form in reports and publications.  Individual responses will not be identifiable.

---------------------------

Traditional and emerging commercial workloads of interest
	-- Transaction processing, decision support, ERP, main memory and
	   streaming database servers 
	-- Multi-tier environments, including e-commerce, web servers and
	   application servers 
	-- Data mining and search engines 
	-- Managed runtime systems (e.g., Java virtual machines) 
	-- Storage system workloads 
	-- Streaming media workloads 
	-- XML-based workloads 

Workload analysis and characterization 
	-- Architecture-independent characterization of workloads 
	-- Impact of input data on workload behavior 
	-- Techniques for comparing workload behavior 
	-- Design and evaluation of synthetic workloads representative
	   of commercial workloads 
	-- Characterization of common components (packet processing,
	   XML processing, garbage collection, etc.) 

Systems architecture and design 
	-- Processor, cache, memory, I/O, or network subsystem design and
	   analysis using commercial workloads 
	-- System-level design and analysis of parallel or multiprocessor
	   servers, including blade servers 
	-- Benefits of multi-core architectures (homogeneous or heterogeneous) 
	-- Benefits of server consolidation (virtual machines) 
	-- Energy-efficiency of commercial workloads 
	-- Application and/or OS kernel algorithm improvements to enhance
	   performance 
	-- Independent validation of previously proposed work using commercial
	   workloads 

Evaluation techniques and methodologies 
	-- Simulation and analytical/statistical modeling techniques for
	   evaluating the performance of commercial workloads 
	-- Validations and comparisons of full-system simulators 
	-- Performance evaluation (hardware/software instrumentation) of
	   existing architectures using commercial workloads 
	-- Scalability considerations for commercial workloads 


Submission guidelines:

IT will take place in Orlando, Florida, USA, from July 12-15, 2007.

All submitted papers will have an extensive reviewing process. A multi-methodological review will be applied in the selection process of this multi-disciplinary conference. Submitted papers or extended abstracts will have three kinds of reviews: double-blind (by at least three reviewers), non-blind, and participative peer-to-peer review. These three reviews will support the selection process of those that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details are given in the conference web site.

Of the papers presented, the best 10%-20% of the papers will be published in Volume 6 of JSCI Journal (www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI) and sent free to over 200 university and research libraries

Also, we would like to invite you to organize an invited session related to a topic of your research interest. If you are interested in organizing an invited session, please, fill out the respective form provided in the conference web page. We will send you a password, so you can include and modify papers in your invited session.

More details about the reviewing process, organizing invited sessions and submissions deadlines can be found at our web site. (http://www.cyber-inf.org/soic2007)

If the deadlines are tight and you need more time, let us know about a suitable time for you and I will inform you if it is feasible for us.

Again, we invite you to participate in the 3rd International Conference on Social and Organizational Informatics and Cybernetics (SOIC 2007) which in the past has had participants from over 80 countries.

They attract hundreds of academics and educators from all over the World. Past conferences have been hosted by reputed universities in Taiwan, Brazil, Czech Republic, United States, Norway, United Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Puerto Rico.  Preliminary information about ICEE-007 is attached.

We invite you to submit abstracts and to be with us in the ICEE 2007. The deadline for the presentation of abstracts, which can be done directly on line at http://icee2007.dei.uc.pt <http://icee2007.dei.uc.pt/> , is February 16, 2007. Also we will appreciate your suggestions of topics for regular and workshop sessions; the due date for suggestions, which may be done online or by e-mail addressed to the Conference Chair or Co-Chair, is December 31, 2006.

ICEE-2007 will take place at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, the perfect environment to discuss the big challenges facing engineering education in our modern society.  The University of Coimbra, now seven-century old, is the oldest University in Portugal and one of the oldest universities in Europe.  Its historical buildings are the premises of a medieval palace situated on the highest hill of the town of Coimbra overlooking the Mondego River.  St. Peter College, St. Michael Chapel, the Rector‚Äôs Palace, the Grand Hall, the King John Library are world-renown landmarks situated on campus.

Coimbra, the first capital of Portugal, is a place full of tradition and beauty.  Cathedrals, churches, monasteries, museums and gardens are jewels of a past where history and legend mix and interweave delight and enchant all visitors.

We will be delighted to have you with us in Coimbra next September.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any question or need further information.

         Part of FCRC (colocated with PLDI, ISCA etc.)
                 http://www.acm.org/fcrc/

           San Diego, California, June, 2007



CONFERENCE SCOPES
As the complexity of embedded system s increases, new
research challenges are encountered for achieving the
desired design goals, such as programmability, reliability
and security, size, energy and power, timing constraints,
and scalability. Furthermore, embedded systems are
increasingly used in networked (wired, wireless, as well as
mobile) environments which enable a variety of new applications.
LCTES 2007 solicits papers presenting original work on
programming languages, compilers and tools for embedded
systems, as well as novel embedded architectures. Research
papers (which propose innovative techniques) and experience
papers (which report experimentation with and lessons learned
from real-world systems and applications) are both welcome.
(For more details of topics, please see the on-line Call for
Papers.) In addition to its regular sessions, LCTES 2007
will feature special events such as an industrial panel,
keynotes, tutorials and demonstrations to bring out the
latest and more interesting aspects of embedded systems.
Examples include tools for multi-cores, emerging platforms
such as smart phones multi-player game machines and real-time
multi-media players.

 "Voltage Regulators and Capacitor Placement in Three-phase Distribution Sy=
stems with Non-linear and Unbalanced Loads", International Journal of Emerg=
ing Electric Power Systems: Vol. 7: No. 4, Article 1.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art1

ABSTRACT:
This paper investigates the problem of contemporaneously choosing optimal l=
ocations and sizes for both shunt capacitors and series voltage regulators =
in three-phase unbalanced distribution systems. The sizing and placement pr=
ocedure not only minimizes the power losses along distribution feeders but =
also makes sure that both capacitors and series regulators will have the mi=
nimum possible impact on the harmonic distortion of bus voltages in the sys=
tem. The fact that distribution systems can operate under unbalanced loadin=
g conditions means that the optimization will have to account for any unbal=
ances in the system. A genetic algorithm, which successfully solves the abo=
ve-described problem, is developed and tested. This paper presents the resu=
lts of simulations for a 34-bus IEEE distribution test system.


Vipin Garg, Bhim Singh, and G Bhuvaneswari (2006) "A Tapped Star Connected =
Autotransformer Based 24-Pulse AC-DC Converter for Power Quality Improvemen=
t in Induction Motor Drives", International Journal of Emerging Electric Po=
wer Systems: Vol. 7: No. 4, Article 2.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art2

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents the design, analysis and development of a novel tapped =
star connected autotransformer based twenty-four-pulse ac-dc converter for =
improving power quality at the point of common coupling (PCC) in vector con=
trolled induction motor drives (VCIMD's). A star connected autotransformer =
with four windings per phase at different phase angles is used to realize t=
he proposed twenty-four-pulse ac-dc converter. The basic design equations a=
re derived to calculate the number of turns in different windings for achie=
ving the harmonic reduction in the proposed autotransformer. The design of =
autotransformer is further modified for making it suitable for retrofit app=
lications to replace presently used 6-pulse diode bridge rectifier. The pro=
posed 24-pulse ac-dc converter is able to eliminate up to 21st harmonics in=
 the supply current along with the power factor improvement close to unity =
in the wide operating range of the drive. The effect of load variation on V=
CIMD is also studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ac-dc=
 converter. Different power quality indices on input ac mains and on dc bus=
 for a VCIMD fed from a 12-pulse and a 24-pulse ac-dc converters are also g=
iven to compare their performance. Various tests are conducted on the devel=
oped prototype of proposed autotransformer based 24-pulse ac-dc converter. =
Different power quality indices are measured on developed 24-pulse ac-dc co=
nverter to validate the design and simulation model.


Harnaak Khalsa and Jingxin Zhang (2006) "A New Definition of Non-Active Pow=
er", International Journal of Emerging Electric Power Systems: Vol. 7: No. =
4, Article 3.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art3

ABSTRACT:
There is no unique definition of non-active power for nonsinusoidal systems=
. A new definition of non-active power is proposed in this paper. This defi=
nition is based on energy transfer and provides a unique solution for non-a=
ctive power of single-phase systems under both sinusoidal and non-sinusoida=
l conditions. An example is used to illustrate the use of this new definiti=
on. Energy transfer calculated using the new definition provides the same e=
nergy transfer determined from the non-sinusoidal non-active instantaneous =
power. This is consistent with the existing definition of active power that=
 is also based on energy transfer.

ural Networks", International Journal of Emerging Electric Power Systems: V=
ol. 7: No. 4, Article 4.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art4

ABSTRACT:
This paper presents an approach for short-term electricity price and load f=
orecasting using the artificial neural network (ANN) computing technique. T=
he described approach uses the three-layered ANN paradigm with back-propaga=
tion. The publicly available data, acquired from the deregulated Victorian =
power system, was used for training and testing the ANN. The ANN approach b=
ased on similarity technique has been proposed according to which the load =
and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being =
similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors=
 is used for the selection of similar days. Two different ANN models, one f=
or load forecasting and another for price forecasting, have been proposed. =
Test results show that average price and load MAPEs for the year 2003 by us=
ing the ANN approach are obtained as 14.29% and 0.95%, respectively. MAPE v=
alues obtained from the price and load forecasting results confirm consider=
able value of the ANN based approach in forecasting short-term electricity =
prices and loads.

f Variable Structure Controller Using Fuzzy PI Type Sliding Surface: An App=
lication to Load-Frequency Control Problem", International Journal of Emerg=
ing Electric Power Systems: Vol. 7: No. 4, Article 5.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art5

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, a proportional plus integral (PI) type sliding surface has b=
een proposed for designing a fuzzy variable structure controller to solve l=
oad-frequency control problem in presence of load disturbances. It is shown=
 that the proposed controller is effective and robust enough when the syste=
m suffers from mismatched condition but the model uncertainty and disturban=
ce are assumed to be bounded. Furthermore, the proposed control strategy dr=
ives the states to the sliding surface and also maintains the sliding motio=
n. To illustrate the approach presented has been tested on load-frequency c=
ontrol of power systems and the analytical claims have been justified under=
 the uncertainty involved in the load demand of inter-connected power syste=
ms.

ed on Wide Area Signal", International Journal of Emerging Electric Power S=
ystems: Vol. 7: No. 4, Article 6.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art6

ABSTRACT:
HVDC and FACTS devices have been widely applied in power system for their e=
xcellent and flexible control ability. Their contributions to the damping o=
f system oscillations are of great importance for achieving satisfactory sy=
stem performance. However, previous experience has shown that there may be =
negative interactions among FACTS devices whose supplementary controllers a=
re designed separately. This may deteriorate system performance and even ma=
ke system unstable. The interactions of HVDC and SVC during system oscillat=
ion were analyzed in this paper. The coordinate supplementary damping contr=
oller for HVDC and SVC were then designed based on projective control princ=
iple. The criterion of synthetic residue is adopted in choosing the proper =
input wide area signals. Eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations we=
re performed on a two-area system and the results demonstrated the effectiv=
eness of the proposed controller.


Himanshu Kumar Singh, S.C. Srivastava, and Ashwani Kumar Sharma (2006) "Sen=
sitivity Based Approach for Transmission Congestion Management Utilizing Bi=
ds for Generation Rescheduling and Load Curtailment", International Journal=
 of Emerging Electric Power Systems: Vol. 7: No. 4, Article 7.
http://www.bepress.com/ijeeps/vol7/iss4/art7

ABSTRACT:
One of the most important tasks of System Operator (SO) is to manage conges=
tion as it threatens system security and may cause rise in electricity pric=
e resulting in market inefficiency. In corrective action congestion managem=
ent schemes, it is crucial for SO to select the most sensitive generators t=
o re-schedule their real and reactive powers and the loads to curtail in ex=
treme congestion management. This paper proposed the selection of most sens=
itive generators and loads to re-schedule their generation and load curtail=
ment based on the improved line flow sensitivity indices to manage congesti=
on. The impact of slack bus on power flow sensitivity factors has been dete=
rmined to encourage fair competition in the electricity markets. Effect of =
bilateral and multilateral transactions, and impact of multi-line congestio=
n on congestion cost has also been studied. The generators' reactive power =
bid has been modeled by a continuous differentiable tangent hyperbolic func=
tion. The proposed concept of congestion management has been tested on a pr=
actical 75-bus Indian system and IEEE-118-bus test system.

         2007 ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers
                        Sponsored by ACM SIGMICRO
                              Ischia, Italy
                              May 7-9, 2007

      AIMS AND SCOPE

        The increasing needs of present and future computation-intensive
      applications have stimulated research in new and innovative  
approaches
      to the design and implementation of high-performance computing  
systems
    . These challenging boundaries between state of the art and  
innovation
      constitute the computing frontiers, which must push forward and  
provide
      the computational support required for the advancement of all  
science
      domains and applications.
        This conference focuses on a wide spectrum of advanced  
technologies and
      radically new solutions, and is designed to foster  
communication between
      the various scientific areas and disciplines involved.


      Papers are sought in the following research areas and on any  
related
      topics:

        Non-conventional Computing: As we reach the limits of CMOS we  
need to
      explore non-conventional architectural paradigms such as quantum
      computing, analog computing, biological computing, and reversible
      computing.

        High-performance Embedded Architectures: The goal of future  
embedded
      systems is to extract high-performance at low power for specific
      applications often under real-time constraints. However they  
must remain
      highly programmable and adaptable at low cost. They can include
      high-performance general or special purpose processors, and  
reconfigurable
      (adaptable) architectures.

        High-performance General-purpose Architectures: Future
      micro-architectures will be multiprocessor-based. The critical  
issues will
      remain harnessing thread-level parallelism through new  
programming models
      and new architectural paradigms such as transactional memory,  
fighting the
      memory wall, and fostering closer interactions between all  
levels of
      hardware and software.

        Technology-driven Architectures: With increased  
miniaturization of CMOS,
      architectures must help solve various issues related to the  
technology
      such as power consumption, design complexity, impact of wire  
delay, and
      reliability.

        Massively Parallel Systems (MPS): Fine grain and coarse grain  
systems,
      very large-scale shared-memory and message-passing  
architectures, software
      support for MPS, grid computing, prototypes and real machines  
based on MPS
      technologies.

        Software for Emerging Systems: Virtualization, programming  
models, high-
      productivity tools, and mapping of large applications on massively
      parallel systems.


      Submit an electronic copy of your paper (PDF formatted), double- 
spaced
      and not exceeding 6000 words, following the instructions at the  
conference
      site: http://www.computingfrontiers.org.

      Workshop proposals are solicited and should be submitted to  
Lucian Prodan
      at lprodan@cs.upt.ro by December 8, 2006.

         2007 ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers
                        Sponsored by ACM SIGMICRO
                              Ischia, Italy
                              May 7-9, 2007

      AIMS AND SCOPE

        The increasing needs of present and future computation-intensive
      applications have stimulated research in new and innovative  
approaches
      to the design and implementation of high-performance computing  
systems
    . These challenging boundaries between state of the art and  
innovation
      constitute the computing frontiers, which must push forward and  
provide
      the computational support required for the advancement of all  
science
      domains and applications.
        This conference focuses on a wide spectrum of advanced  
technologies and
      radically new solutions, and is designed to foster  
communication between
      the various scientific areas and disciplines involved.


      Papers are sought in the following research areas and on any  
related
      topics:

        Non-conventional Computing: As we reach the limits of CMOS we  
need to
      explore non-conventional architectural paradigms such as quantum
      computing, analog computing, biological computing, and reversible
      computing.

        High-performance Embedded Architectures: The goal of future  
embedded
      systems is to extract high-performance at low power for specific
      applications often under real-time constraints. However they  
must remain
      highly programmable and adaptable at low cost. They can include
      high-performance general or special purpose processors, and  
reconfigurable
      (adaptable) architectures.

        High-performance General-purpose Architectures: Future
      micro-architectures will be multiprocessor-based. The critical  
issues will
      remain harnessing thread-level parallelism through new  
programming models
      and new architectural paradigms such as transactional memory,  
fighting the
      memory wall, and fostering closer interactions between all  
levels of
      hardware and software.

        Technology-driven Architectures: With increased  
miniaturization of CMOS,
      architectures must help solve various issues related to the  
technology
      such as power consumption, design complexity, impact of wire  
delay, and
      reliability.

        Massively Parallel Systems (MPS): Fine grain and coarse grain  
systems,
      very large-scale shared-memory and message-passing  
architectures, software
      support for MPS, grid computing, prototypes and real machines  
based on MPS
      technologies.

        Software for Emerging Systems: Virtualization, programming  
models, high-
      productivity tools, and mapping of large applications on massively
      parallel systems.


      Submit an electronic copy of your paper (PDF formatted), double- 
spaced
      and not exceeding 6000 words, following the instructions at the  
conference
      site: http://www.computingfrontiers.org.

      Workshop proposals are solicited and should be submitted to  
Lucian Prodan
      at lprodan@cs.upt.ro by December 8, 2006.

The Design Automation Conference (DAC) has announced the executive committee. 
Gabe Moretti, editor

The committee will serve under the direction of Steven Levitan, Professor of Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, who was previously
selected as General Chair for the 44th DAC. Levitan's research includes the design, modeling, simulation, and verification of mixed technology
micro-systems, including sensing, computing, and communications functions. He has served as chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Design
Automation (SIGDA) and has been a member of the DAC executive committee since 1998 You can read an in-depth interview with Dr. Levitan in this issue.

The volunteer executive committee for DAC is responsible for planning the technical program, overseeing the exhibition, establishing new initiatives,
and managing operations and publicity for the conference. Limor Fix, from Intel's Research in Pittsburgh, PA. is the Vice-Chair and will also handle
the duties of the Finance Chair. The extremely demanding job of Technical Program Chair is divided among two professionals. Leon Stok of IBM
Corporation will handle Design Methods, while Sachin Sapatnekar from the University of Minnesota will be responsible for Design Tools.

Tutorials will be the responsibility of Narenda Shenoy from Synopsys and Andrew Kahng, from the University of California in San Diego will manage the
selection and handling of Panels. This year's Theme is Automotive Electronics and Dennis Brophy, from Mentor Graphics is responsible for this
dimension of the conference. 

Other members of the executive committee include: Yervant Zorian of Virage Logic, Ellen Sentovich from Cadence, Kaushik Roy Professor at Purdue
University, Nanette Collins, Georges Gielen of the Katholieke University in Leuven Belgium, Yusuke Matsunaga from the Kyushu University Kagus in
Fukuoka Japan, Diana Marculescu of Carnegie Mellon University, Alan Mantooth of the University of Arkansas, and Anne Cirkel from Mentor Graphics. As
usual, DAC will be managed by MP Associates of Boulder, Colorado. Lee Wood will serve as the Exhibit Manager and Kevin Lepine as the Conference
Manager.  

In addition to the interview with Steve Levitan we plan to feature, in the coming months, interviews with Limor Fix, Leon Stok, and Sachin
Sapatnekar.

DAC 2007 General Chair Steve Levitan is no stranger to the mysteries behind the magic of the Design Automation Conference. He's been on the DAC
Executive Committee for 9 years-4 years in his capacity as Chair of SIGDA [ACM's Special Interest Group for Design Automation], 3 years as Multi
Media Chair, a year as the New Initiatives Chair, and a year as Vice Chair of the conference. Now entering his tenth year on the Executive Committee
(EC), Levitan is General Chair of DAC and there are few mysteries left for him.

He knows the event requires careful coordination of hundreds of volunteers and tens of thousands of hours of effort, a delicate balancing act between
the needs of academia and those of industry, and a constant vigilance to guarantee that the latest and greatest in technology are adequately showcased
during the week. He is no stranger to the commitment, sacrifice, and tedious attention to detail needed to make the conference happen.

Nonetheless, if you have a chance to speak to Steve Levitan about DAC, you'll quickly see that he still firmly believes in the magic. He believes
when thousands of people come together in a single venue to discuss everything EDA, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and the industry
and its technology take yet another tangible step forward to the benefit of all involved. Levitan says, "It's simply amazing to see the passion that
people bring to the work of making the Design Automation Conference a reality. It takes a lot of people and a lot of effort, and it's an
all-volunteer organization. There are 16 members on the EC, while the Technical Committee for DAC 2007 has over 80 members. Adding to that headcount,
there's the Panels Subcommittee, the Tutorials Group & Subcommittees, the Exhibitor Liaison Committee, and the Strategic Planning Committee. And that
doesn't even touch on the number of people from MP Associates, who manage the day to day operations. It's just a huge undertaking."

DAC 2006 in San Francisco logged over 10,000 attendees and DAC 2007, scheduled for early June in San Diego, could be even larger. Levitan says, "Both
the total number of paper, panels,and tutorial submissions and the number of companies participating in 2007 should be up compared to 2006, which was
already at the highest participation level in years. Early indicators suggest there are lots of new and interesting ideas to be explored at DAC.
Although, of course, what the hottest topics at DAC 2007 will be is not yet settled, but you can certainly see some of them reflected in the various
Special Sessions proposals being considered by the EC for the 2007 program. We'll know better in a couple of months, but it wouldn't be surprising to
see topics of evolutionary advances in CAD, new ways of looking at the die, at fabrication technology, and DFM. Also, statistical modeling and robust,
variation-tolerant design will undoubtedly be highlighted, as well."

Although Levitan is an academic, the John A. Jurenko Professor of Computer Engineering in the ECE Department at The University of Pittsburgh, he is
fully aware that one of the biggest challenges at DAC is to maintain and support both the commercial and academic aspects of the conference.

He says, "Although the hot topics at DAC are often forward looking, it's also important to remember that many of the technologies are being
commercialized right now. And that process adds to the fascinating dynamic at DAC. It's an extremely complex conference because it has such a diverse
audience. There are a lot of people on the exhibit hall floor involved in industry who may not make it upstairs to the technical sessions, while there
are also a lot of people upstairs from academia who don't appear to give a whit about what's going on downstairs. It can seem as if these two
communities are disconnected, but in reality the best of each community is fully aware of the best of the other community. And that's where the magic
of DAC resides."

"Every year, several of us who are academics make a point of walking the exhibit hall floor and looking at the new tools from each company. We ask
ourselves, where did this work come from, was this a technology that was developed in-house, came from a company that was acquired, or was this
so-and-so's work at a particular university? Those of us who participate in this exercise are really conscious of the whole food chain in EDA and the
history of the companies, not to mention the Ph.D. theses driving this or that technology. By the same token, people from the companies-Cadence,
Synopsys, Mentor, Magma, and so on-are often upstairs sitting in the technical sessions taking copious notes during the presentations. There's a
synergy that takes place at DAC that definitely defines and defends the ongoing need for this conference."

Levitan says guaranteeing the quality of the technical program is crucial to the synergy and to maintaining the pre-eminence of DAC within the
research community. "We are confronted with a challenging situation with regards to the technical portion of the program at the Design Automation
Conference. Some academics believe that a paper published in a print journal is worth more than a paper presented at a conference, and that may be
true for some conferences. But that's not true for DAC. The review process that goes into selecting the papers presented at DAC is equal to-or
surpasses-the peer-review process involved for journal publication. The DAC quality selection process is directly linked to the caliber of our large
technical review committee, and the amount of time they take to evaluate each submission."

Even more crucial than the technical program itself, however, is the research food chain that produces the submissions in the first place. Levitan
says that the quality and quantity of that research hinges on the ability of the universities to attract bright, innovative graduate students and the
funding to support them.

He notes, "There is an evolutionary nature to this process. People do interesting work in academia, which often becomes the basis for a startup,
which then evolves into a full-blown company or an acquisition into an existing EDA company. So there's a path from the graduate students-funded by
the SRC, NSF, DARPA, or the CAD companies themselves-into industry. The grants for these students are reviewed not just by academics, but by industry
people as well, which means your work in academia is being evaluated by the industry year-round, not just at DAC. Also, many grad students do summer
internships at the CAD companies, and often go on to work for those companies as developers after graduation, or as tool users in the customer
companies. So from the very beginning, there's always been a tight relationship between academia and industry within the EDA world. It's quite
unique."

"Unfortunately today," he adds, "that whole evolutionary process has gotten quite difficult. It's hard these days to get access from within the
universities to the state-of-the-art technologies being developed-things like 90 nanometer and 45 nanometer production processes-either because of
NDAs, or because the universities discourage research work that comes with restrictions; because this is the type of work that a company might fund,
but might not want openly published. Many universities have found creative ways to get around these barriers, perhaps by taking their research
farther afield than what the mainline companies are looking at right now."

Nonetheless, Levitan notes that many universities really want to be looking at the current, cutting-edge problems. They don't want to be working on
esoteric technologies with minimal practical applications. He says, "We want to do real work on real-world problems, because that means our students
can have access to practical examples and applications for their work. They spend a lot of time solving problems and want to see if the solutions
they develop are useful. 

"Basically, the real issue is that university professors just want to be successful. They can't work by themselves-they can't write 100,000 lines of
code by themselves to solve a problem-so they need to have a research group. But to build that group they have to ask themselves, does the money come
from Federal grants or from industry? There are differing opinions on all of this, but ultimately the ability to create and sustain a research group
is important. It's important for the tenure of the professor, and it's important for the graduate students who need the funding to attend school in
the first place. Ultimately, of course, it's important to industry that this process continues uninterrupted."

Levitan says that today many administrators are encouraging an entrepreneurial attitude within the university setting. Senior faculty members are
encouraged to teach the junior faculty, who in turn need to teach the graduate students, that the university is not just an ivory tower. Faculty and
students alike need to develop and market their ideas to secure the necessary funding to pursue them. Per Levitan, "The process that professors need
to master is one of couching their research processes and their expected results in a way that people outside the university can really understand."
And that, he insists, means the universities have an obligation to commercialize their technology.

Which brings us back to DAC. Levitan is excited when he says it's at DAC that the universities are able to efficiently showcase their nascent
technologies and emerging research stars in close proximity to the bulk of the commercial players within the industry. It's at DAC that a company who
might license or fund a technology coming out of a university has a great opportunity to hear about projects that have potential applicability to
their own portfolio of tools or in-house research initiatives. It's also at DAC that researchers from industry who have worked side-by-side with
researchers from academia enjoy the opportunity to showcase their joint efforts.

All of this, Steve Levitan says, is part of the dynamic-and the dynamism-that fuels a widespread commitment to DAC across the board, from industry
and academia. Levitan is unequivocal in his belief that the magic of DAC resides in its impact on the evolution of the tools for electronic design
automation. He believes that his efforts, and the efforts of the countless others who are working to make the next conference a success, are
important and the results will be substantive.

There are no mysteries to the amount of work needing to be done between now and next June to make the Design Automation Conference in San Diego a
success. No mysteries-but in the end, there will be magic. And starting on June 4th, 2007, DAC General Chair Steve Levitan will be waving the wand.

                        SELSE-3

         Silicon Errors in Logic - System Effects

                 April 3rd and 4th, 2007

                     Austin, Texas

                 http://www.selse.org

 

The growing complexity and shrinking geometries of modern device

technologies are making these high-density, low-voltage devices

increasingly susceptible to influences from electrical noise, process

variation, and natural radiation interference. System-level effects of

these errors can be far reaching. Growing concern about intermittent

errors, erratic storage cells, and the effects of aging are

influencing system design. This workshop provides a forum for

discussing current research and practices in system-level error

management. Participants from industry and academia explore both

current technologies and future research direction (including

nanotechnology). We are interested in soliciting papers that cover

system-level effects of errors from a variety of perspectives:

architectural, logical and circuit-level, and semiconductor

processes. Case studies are also solicited. 

 

Key areas of interest are (but not limited to):

* Technology trends and the impact on error rates. 

* New error mitigation techniques. 

* Characterizing the overhead and design complexity of error 

  mitigation techniques.  

* Case studies describing the engineering tradeoffs necessary to 

  decide what mitigation technique to apply. 

* Experimental data.

* System-level models: derating factors and validation of error

  models.

         Silicon Errors in Logic - System Effects

                 April 3rd and 4th, 2007

                     Austin, Texas

                 http://www.selse.org

 

The growing complexity and shrinking geometries of modern device

technologies are making these high-density, low-voltage devices

increasingly susceptible to influences from electrical noise, process

variation, and natural radiation interference. System-level effects of

these errors can be far reaching. Growing concern about intermittent

errors, erratic storage cells, and the effects of aging are

influencing system design. This workshop provides a forum for

discussing current research and practices in system-level error

management. Participants from industry and academia explore both

current technologies and future research direction (including

nanotechnology). We are interested in soliciting papers that cover

system-level effects of errors from a variety of perspectives:

architectural, logical and circuit-level, and semiconductor

processes. Case studies are also solicited. 

 

Key areas of interest are (but not limited to):

* Technology trends and the impact on error rates. 

* New error mitigation techniques. 

* Characterizing the overhead and design complexity of error 

  mitigation techniques.  

* Case studies describing the engineering tradeoffs necessary to 

  decide what mitigation technique to apply. 

* Experimental data.

* System-level models: derating factors and validation of error

  models. 

* Error handling protocols (higher-level protocols for robust system

  design). 

 

Authors are requested to submit their extended abstracts for review

before December 20, 2006. Guidelines for submission are available at

www.selse.org. Submissions should be PDF or Microsoft Word files that

do not exceed four printed pages. Customary terms for copyright

agreement and non-confidentiality will apply. Authors will be notified

of paper outcome by March 2, 2007. The camera-ready formatted papers

are due on March 23, 2007. 

 

Registration information is posted on the workshop website:

                   The 6th International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Economics and Finance (CIEF2007)
			                             15-22 July 2007 
	                                   Marriott Salt Lake City Center, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA
			                           http://www.jcis.org/

The 6th International conference on Computational Intelligence in Economics and Finance (CIEF 2007) will be held as a part of the 
10th Joint Conference on Information Sciences (JCIS 2007). CIEF continues the tradition of featuring applications of computational 
intelligence to solve challenging problems in economics and finance. Potential researchers are welcome to organize special sessions 
in this conference. Each special session devoted to new techniques and/or novel applications are solicited and tools related to 
computational intelligence are also welcome. All accepted papers in the special sessions will be included in the proceedings of the 
10th Joint Conference on Information Sciences (JCIS 2007).

Please submit the special session proposals to Program chair, Dr. Tzai-Der Wang (Email: dougwang@csu.edu.tw) before February, 1, 
2007. The notification of acceptance will be sent in time after your special session proposal is received. Proposals for special sessions 
should not exceed two pages in length and should contain the following information:

	1. A title of the special session. 
	2. Description of the topics the special sessions is intended to focus on. 
	3. Chair(s) and their detailed contact addresses 
	   (e-mail and postal addresses, fax, and telephone numbers).

More details for special session chairs are:

(1) Special session papers should be submitted to the special session chair(s) directly for review. The review process will be 
coordinated and supervised by the special session chair(s). 
 
(2) Acceptance/rejection decisions for the special session papers are made and communicated to the authors by the session chair(s). 
Once the special session papers are accepted, camera-ready copies of the accepted papers should be submitted directly to the 
session chair(s). The Program chair will collect the papers later from all chairs in order to arrange the sessions and to include those 
papers into the conference proceedings.

(3) All papers should be reviewed by at least two reviewers. Session chairs can be reviewers.

(4) Every special session normally has 5~6 papers. If there are fewer than 5 papers in your session, we may merge your session into 
the regular tracks of CIEF2007. If there are more than 6 papers in your session, two or more sessions might be allocated to you.

(5) The deadline for camera-ready copies of accepted papers is the same as that of the regular papers, i.e., June 10, 2007. However, 
the submission deadline for the special session is decided by the individual special session chair(s).  

(6) All special session papers should be prepared according to format of regular papers for JCIS2007, i.e., double columns, single-
spaced in a 10 point font such as Times Roman and limit to 4 pages. More detail of paper format can be found on JCIS2007 
conference website (http://www.jcis.org/).

(7) The special session chair should prepare the call for papers which should be sent to Program chair Dr. Tzai-Der Wang by emails. 
The program chair will assist to upload information onto the conference website and will distribute the Call for Papers of special 
sessions through emails.

We appreciate your contribution to organize a special session for CIEF2007 and hope to meet you in Salt Lake City in July!

Purpose / History:

   This set of joint conferences is the largest annual gathering of
   researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied
   computing.  Many of the 24 joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
   premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective
   fields.  Most of these conferences have been evaluated and determined
   to be top tier research conferences
   (see http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/index.html for an example).
   We anticipate to have 2000 or more attendees from over 75 countries
   participating in the 2007 joint conferences.

   The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research
   conferences into a coordinated research meeting held in a common
   place at a common time.  The main goal is to provide a forum for
   exchange of ideas in a number of research areas that interact.  The
   model used to form these annual conferences facilitates communication
   among researchers from all over the world in different fields of
   computer science, computer engineering and applied computing.  Both
   inward research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and
   outward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and
   applications) will be covered during the conferences.

Proposal for Organizing Sessions/Workshops:

   Each session will have at least 6 paper presentations from different
   authors (12 papers in the case of workshops).  The session chairs
   will be responsible for all aspects of their sessions; including,
   soliciting papers, reviewing, selecting, ...  The names of session
   chairs will appear as Associate Editors in the conference proceedings
   and on the cover of the books.

   Proposals to organize sessions should include the following information:
   name and address (+ email) of proposer, title of session, a 100-word
   description of the topic of the session, the name of the conference the
   session is submitted for consideration, and a short description on how
   the session will be advertised (in most cases, session proposers solicit
   papers from colleagues and researchers whose work is known to the
   session proposer).  E-mail your proposal to H. R. Arabnia (address is
   given above).  We would like to receive the proposals by December 29, 2006.

Submission of Papers:

   Prospective authors are invited to submit their draft/full paper
   (about 5 to 8 pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12) to
   H. R. Arabnia by Feb. 20, 2007. E-mail submissions in MS document or
   PDF formats are preferable (Fax or postal submissions are also fine.)
   All reasonable typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors
   of accepted papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting
   format to prepare their papers for publication.)

   The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be limited to
   7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been previously published
   or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The first page of
   the draft paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation,
   postal address, email address, and telephone number for each author.
   The first page should also identify the name of the author who will
   be presenting the paper (if accepted) and a maximum of 5 topical
   keywords that would best represent the content of the paper.  Finally,
   the name of the conference that the paper is being submitted to must be
   stated on the first page.

   Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, impact,
   and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts in the field
   who are independent of the conference program committee.  The referees'
   evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of the program
   committee who will recommend a decision to the chair of the track that
   the paper has been submitted to.  The chair will make the final decision.
   Lastly, the Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by one member of the
   program committee.

Members of Program and Organizing Committees:

   The Program Committee includes members of chapters of World Academy
   of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientific computing; artificial
   intelligence; imaging science; databases; simulation; software
   engineering; embedded systems; internet and web technologies;
   communications; computer security; and bioinformatics.) The Program
   Committee for individual conferences is currently being compiled. Those
   interested in joining the Program Committee should email H. R. Arabnia
   (hra@cs.uga.edu) the following information: Name, affiliation and
   position, complete mailing address, email address, tel/fax numbers,
   a short biography together with research interests and the name of
   the conference offering to help with.

Location of Conferences:

   The conferences will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort hotel, Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other near-by hotels).  The Monte
   Carlo Resort is a mega hotel with excellent conference facilities and
   over 3,000 rooms.  The hotel is minutes from the airport with 24-hour
   shuttle service to and from the airport.  This hotel has many
   recreational attractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools, sunning
   decks, Easy River water ride, wave pool, lighted tennis courts,
   health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool, sauna, ...),
   nightly shows, snack bars, many restaurants, shopping area, bars, ...
   Many of these attractions are open 24 hours a day and most are suitable
   for families and children.  The negotiated room rate for conference
   attendees is very reasonable.  The hotel is within walking distance
   from most other attractions (major shopping areas, night clubs, free
   street shows, Golf courses, ...).

* Call for papers: CMP-MSI: Workshop on Chip Multiprocessor Memory Systems and Interconnects (w/ HPCA-07)

        CMP-MSI: Workshop on Chip Multiprocessor Memory Systems and Interconnects 

                          In conjunction with the 
        13th Annual International Conference on High-Performance
        Architecture
                                   Sunday, Feb 11, 2007
                                     Phoenix, Arizona 

CALL FOR PAPERS

Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are emerging as the architecture of choice
for future high performance processors. CMPs integrate several high
-performance processing cores onto the same chip. A high performance
interconnect and memory system are necessary to satisfy the data
supply  needs of all these cores especially given the ever increasing
speed gap  between processors and main memory systems. At the same
time, power, complexity and reliability are additional constraints
that must be met by any design. 

The fact that now these components will be tightly integrated onto the
same die presents opportunities and challenges that are very different
than those that existed in previous multi-processor systems. This
workshop aims to become a forum for academia and industry to discuss
and present ideas and recent  developments in the design and
evaluation of on-chip multiprocessor memory systems and
interconnects. 

Two kinds of papers are invited: 

1. Technical papers (up to 6 pages maximum) for relative mature
ideas.  
2. Position papers (2 pages maximum) on directions on research and
development. 

The selected papers will be made available online. However,
publication in CMP-MSI does not preclude later publication at regular
conferences or  journals. 

Topics of interest include: 
* Memory system design and optimizations 
* Interconnect design and optimizations 
* Coherence optimizations 
* Memory system support for alternative execution models such as
transactional memory 
* Memory and interconnect designs for heterogeneous CMP architectures 
* where some of the computation cores are specialized (e.g., GPUs) 
* Support for software optimizations and or enhanced functionality
(e.g., debugging, tracing, checkpointing) 
* Early reports on system prototypes 

Important Dates:

Paper Submission: December 22, 2006 at 9PM PST. 
      Submission information:
		 Please e-mail your paper in PDF and as an attachment
      to cmpmsi07@eecg.toronto.edu.
	 The process is not automated. We will acknowledge paper
      submissions by December 23, 2006.
Author Notification: January 10, 2007.
Final manuscript: January 22, 2007.

Call for Participation
SELSE-3 Workshop, Silicon Errors in Logic - System Effects April 3rd &
4th, 2007 Austin, Texas

The growing complexity and shrinking geometries of modern device
technologies are making these high-density, low-voltage devices
increasingly susceptible to influences from electrical noise, process
variation, and natural radiation interference. System-level effects of
these errors can be far reaching. Growing concern about intermittent
errors, erratic storage cells, and the effects of aging are
influencing
system design. This workshop provides a forum for discussing current
research and practices in system-level error management. Participants
from industry and academia explore both current technologies and
future
research direction (including nanotechnology). We are interested in
soliciting papers that cover system-level effects of errors from a
variety of perspectives: architectural, logical and circuit-level, and
semiconductor processes. Case studies are also solicited.

Key areas of interest are (but not limited to):
* Technology trends and the impact on error rates.
* New error mitigation techniques.
* Characterizing the overhead and design complexity of error
mitigation techniques.
* Case studies describing the engineering tradeoffs necessary to
decide what mitigation technique to apply.
* Experimental data.
* System-level models: derating factors and validation of error
models.
* Error handling protocols (higher-level protocols for robust
system design).

Authors are requested to submit their extended abstracts for review
before December 20, 2006. Guidelines for submission are available at
www.selse.org. Submissions should be PDF or Microsoft Word files that 
do
not exceed four printed pages. Customary terms for copyright agreement
and non-confidentiality will apply. Authors will be notified of paper
outcome by March 2, 2007. The camera-ready formatted papers are due on
March 23, 2007.

Mission
The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software
Engineering) working conferences is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to evaluation of novel approaches to software engineering. By comparing novel approaches with entrenched traditional practices and by evaluating them against software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, identify most hopeful trends and propose new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale software development and integration.
Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include theoretical and/or empirical contributions related to novel approaches to software engineering. Of particular interest are experience reports and evaluations (qualitative and
quantitative) of existing approaches as well as ideas and proposals for improvements or for brand new approaches. Of various software qualities, the working conference emphasizes software adaptiveness (understandability, maintainability and scalability). The working conference solicits experiments, case studies, surveys, meta-analyses, empirical studies, systematic reviews, conceptual explorations, innovative ideas, critical appraisals, etc. related to:

* Software product and process improvement
* Agile software development practices and methodologies (e.g. XP)
* Aspect-oriented software development
* Model driven engineering
* Software components and component-based software engineering
* Web services and service-oriented architectures
* Business process management and process-centric paradigms
* Multi-agent systems and agent-oriented software engineering
* Generative software development
* Evolutionary design
* Intentional software
* Example-centric programming
* Meta programming systems and language workbenches
* Competitive systems engineering
* Knowledge-based systems engineering
* Architectural design and meta-architectures
* Enterprise integration strategies and patterns
* Frameworks and models on requirements engineering
* Cross-feeding between data engineering and software engineering
* Design thinking as a paradigm for software development
* Amalgamation of applications and data sources
* Team based distributed software production
* Other novel approaches and lifecycle models
* New methodologies, practices, architectures, technologies, tools, metrics

Conference Format
There will be full and poster papers. Each full paper will be a presentation, followed by a debate (poster papers will be available for viewing and discussions).
The conference will include panels on selected themes. The panels will consist of 3-4 panel position papers followed by question/answer sessions.
Each day, following the paper presentations, the Advocatus Diaboli (AD) Forum will take place. Renowned experts will be invited as devil's advocates and the "court" proceedings on "canonization" of novel approaches will be conducted.

Conference Publications
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, in paper and in CD-ROM support.
A book including a selection of the best conference papers will be edited and published by Springer. The book will include the papers and the summaries of the AD Forum and the panels.
To coincide with ENASE, a special issue of Springer's Requirements Engineering journal entitled "Software Engineering meets Requirements" 
will be published after the conference and will constitute a publication opportunity for AD Forum contributions.

Dear Engineering Professor,

Progressive Engineer, the online source for engineering-related  
directories and job openings, has posted a new company profile in its  
easy-to-read magazine section. It talks about R.W. Beck, an  
engineering and management consulting firm with offices all over the  
country that specializes in electric utilities and other forms of  
infrastructure such as water and wastewater and solid waste. The firm  
not only has expertise in engineering but also operations,  
construction management, and business aspects. You can see this at  
http://www.ProgressiveEngineer.com

We remind you that in addition to its Engineering firm Directory,  
Progressive Engineer also has its Sustainability Firm Directory,  
which consists of firms involved in areas such as renewable energy,  
recycling, life cycle analysis, and energy conservation.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom Gibson, P.E.

* NSF Funding Deadline (Jan. 17th) for the AES/SMA components of the CSR program

Program Title: 

Computer Systems Research (CSR)

Synopsis of Program:

Computer systems are ubiquitous, and society is increasingly dependent on them. They range from microprocessors embedded in automobiles and appliances, to worldwide grids of advanced processors, storage, graphics devices, and instruments interconnected by high-speed networks. Computer systems include large amounts of systems software.  Systems software has two main roles: to provide abstractions and services that facilitate the implementation and execution of application programs; and, to orchestrate effective use of the underlying hardware resources through these abstractions and services.  Computer systems are being applied to increasingly demanding applications. The environments in which they function and the resource configurations to be orchestrated are becoming more diverse, distributed and dynamic. While the time scales for control decisions are shrinking, the scale and complexity of the systems are increasing.  The assumptions underlying current system software no lo!
 nger hold in many cases. Moreover, current computer systems often fail, become compromised or perform poorly because of failures of system software. Responding to these challenges requires new directions in computer systems research. 

The Computer Systems Research (CSR) program supports innovative research and education projects that have the potential to:

lead to significant improvements in computer systems by increasing our fundamental understanding of them;
address challenges raised by new technologies or system requirements;
lead to systems software that is quantifiably more reliable, easier to use, and/or more efficient; and
produce innovative curricula or educational materials that better prepare the next generation of computing professionals.
The CSR program also supports projects that expand the capabilities of computer systems by exploiting the potential of new technologies or by developing innovative new ways to use existing technologies.  CSR-funded projects will strive to make significant progress on challenging high-impact problems, as opposed to incremental progress on familiar problems.  To be successful, CSR proposals must have credible plans for demonstrating the utility and potential impact of the proposed work.

The CSR program is partitioned into two parts:

CORE areas - to support traditional CSR research and education topics.  CSR core areas are: Embedded and Hybrid Systems (EHS); Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems (PDOS); Advanced Execution Systems (AES); and Systems Modeling and Analysis (SMA).  Awards in the core areas may take one of two forms:
Single Investigator and Small Group awards. These awards will include one or two PIs, with budgets of up to $800,000 total, and award durations of two or three years. The estimated average award size is $450,000.
Team awards.  These awards will include three or more PIs, with budgets of up to $1,500,000 total, and award durations of three or four years. The estimated average award size is $900,000.
THEMATIC areas - to stimulate research and education in topics that are considered timely and of emerging importance.  Specific thematic areas may change from year to year.  In FY 2007, the thematic areas are: Cross-Systems Integration (CSI); Virtualization for Configuration Management (VCM); and, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).  Awards in the thematic areas will be smaller by design, with funding levels ranging from $200,000 to $400,000 total, and with award durations of one or two years.
On occasion, the CSR program will accept proposals for workshops and Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGERs). These proposals may be submitted on or before the deadline for this solicitation under the conditions described herein, or they may be submitted at any other time in accordance with GPG guidelines.  However, prior to submission of any workshop or SGER proposal, a PI must discuss their interests with a CSR Program Officer before submitting the proposal. Additional information about SGER proposals can be found in Section II.D.1. of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG).

* Call for Papers: International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC 2007)

To deal with the increasing complexity of large-scale computing systems, computers and applications must learn to manage themselves in accordance with high-level guidance from humans – a vision referred to as autonomic computing (AC). Meeting the grand challenges of AC requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, in addition to new software and system architectures that support the effective integration of the constituent technologies.The purpose of the 4th International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) is to bring together researchers and practitioners addressing aspects of self-management in computing systems, thereby developing and nurturing a community that can work together to realize the vision of large-scale self-managing systems. Papers are solicited on a broad array of topics of relevance to AC particularly those that bear relationships among different areas of research or report on prototype systems or experiences. Topics of !
 interest include, but are not limited to:•	Production or prototype AC systems that exhibit self* features such as self-monitoring, self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and/or self-protection.•	Self-managing element such as server, storage, network, or application. Emphasis should be placed on techniques or lessons that may generalize to other elements.•	Management topics such as specification and modeling of business-level policies and their mapping to runtime management, including service-level agreements, negotiation or conversation support, and behavior enforcement, design processes, tie in with IT governance, and interaction with legacy systems.•	Fundamental science of self-managing systems: understanding, controlling, or exploiting emergent behavior, fault-tolerance, machine learning, control theory, predictive methods and their use to automate manual operations and enforce behavior. •	Software architectures for self-managing systems, based on int!
 eroperable grid services, agent-based systems, web services, m!
 odel-bas
ed systems or novel paradigms such as biological, economic or social. •	System-level technologies, middleware or services that entail interactions among two or more components of self-managing systems such as health monitoring and performance understanding, dependency analysis, problem localization or remediation, workload management, and provisioning).•	Operating system support for autonomic systems, including virtualization, migration, and distributed systems technologies.•	Interfaces to autonomic systems, including user interfaces, interfaces for monitoring and controlling behavior, techniques for defining, distributing, and understanding policies.•	Toolkits, environments, models, languages, runtime and compiler technologies for building self-managing components, systems or applications.•	Experiences with autonomic system or component prototypes: measurements, evaluations, or analyses of system behavior, user studies, or experiences with large-scale deployments of se!
 lf-managing systems or applications.PAPER/POSTER SUBMISSIONS AND PUBLICATIONFull papers (a maximum of 10 pages in length) and posters (2 pages) are invited on a wide variety of AC-related topics as indicated above.

EURASIP Journal on Applied Signal Processing

Special Issue on

Wireless Video

Call for Papers

Motivation

Video transport is becoming increasingly important for a large variety 
of applications and networks. Wireless information exchange will be 
dominated by basic human communication such as messaging, voice, and 
video communication. Because of its typically large bandwidth 
requirements, video communication will emerge as the dominant and 
most critical form of traffic in and beyond 3G/4G wireless systems. 
Digital video transmission over wireless connections has proven to 
be a challenging task, given the hostile communication environment, 
characterized by unpredictable connection quality and significant 
error rates, a limited available bandwidth, and severe energy 
constraints. When developing a reliable and effective video 
transmission system over a wireless-based network, many different 
technical problems must be addressed, some of which may be application- 
or network-specific.

This special issue will focus on the most recent advances in 
applications involving video communication over wireless links. For 
example, P2P or multicast streaming applications will be addressed, 
in which the scalability characteristics of the audiovisual codecs 
may be exploited to define new scheduling and prioritization algorithms 
for the efficient delivery of time-sensitive traffic. Video transmission 
over wireless LANs with critical bandwidth requirements and severe 
energy constraints, such as sensor networks, will also be addressed.

List of Topics

Papers on the following and related topics are solicited:

o Video coding for wireless transmission
   o Advanced video coding algorithms
   o Distributed video coding
   o Error resilience and error concealment techniques
   o Joint source-channel coding
   o Joint restoration and coding
o Video distortion estimation and quality assessment for wireless 
  transmission
o Multiple access for wireless video
o Adaptive techniques for video delivery over wireless networks
o Cross-layer design and optimization techniques for wireless video 
  transmission
o Quality of service support for video delivery over wireless networks
o Wireless video protocols and standards
o DVB-H and mobile TV
o Distributed wireless video communications
o Wireless P2P video streaming

TITLE: 		Robust Tracking for Visual Surveillance	
		
ABSTRACT:	The work described here aims at improving the
performance of two building blocks of visual surveillance systems:
foreground detection and object tracking.

First, a new background subtraction algorithm is presented for
foreground detection. The background model is built with a set of
codewords for every pixel. The codeword contains the pixel's principle
color and a tangent vector that represents the color variation at that
pixel. As the scene illumination changes, a pixel's color is predicted
using a linear model of the codeword and the codeword, in turn, is
updated using the new observation. We carried out a number of
experiments on sequences that have extensive lighting change and compare
with previously developed algorithms.

Second, we present a tracking algorithm based on motion analysis of
regional affine invariant image features. The tracked object is
represented with a probabilistic occupancy map. Using this map as
support, regional features are detected and matched across frames. The
motion of pixels is then established based on the feature motion. The
object occupancy map is in turn updated according to the pixel motion
consistency. We describe experiments to measure the sensitivity of our
approach to inaccuracy in initialization, and compare it with other
approaches.

<P><B>Limor Fix</B>&nbsp;has never worked for an EDA company, but she is <B>Vice Chair of the 2007 Design Automation Conference</B> -- and for good reason. She has been intensely involved throughout her career in evolving the technologies at the core of electronic design automation, both in her former capacity as head of an internal CAD R&D group at Intel, and now as director of an Intel research&nbsp; "lablet" in Pittsburgh located at the campus of Carnegie Mellon University.</P>
<P>Intel has three lablets in North America -- one at CMU, one at U.C. Berkeley, and one at the University of Washington. Limor heads up the facility at CMU, and says the group thrives on innovative contributions from top-notch professors and grad students from university.</P>
<P>Limor says, "In each lablet, there is a small group of Intel employees collaborating with the local university in various technology domains, areas that are important to Intel now, or may become important for Intel in the future. This is a very interesting job for me, one that allows me to look at quite new and exciting ideas. The set of people we have in the labs is very strong, and we are constantly recruiting people from the best universities to join us as Intel employees. Therefore, for every project, we have 2 or 3 fulltime Intel employees plus 2 or 3 professors and PhD students doing research on a topic. In addition, each summer we have 10 to 15 interns in the group. Overall, the
 return is significant because, although each project may have a small number of Intel employees, we accomplish a lot of research through this collaboration."</P>
<P>"Our current topics in Pittsburgh are quite exciting. Among them, we are developing tools and methodologies for parallel software for multi-core products. Many of the new CPUs being introduced -- ones from Intel and AMD, for instance -- have multi-CPUs on the die. Therefore, the way software developers write code has got to change. Because if you're just going to run your old software on a mutli-core PC, you're not going to enjoy the additional power of the newer configuration."</P>
<P>"We are also working on a related project to develop parallel Satisfiability (SAT) solver, an important building block for formal verification, synthesis and other CAD applications. Our new parallel SAT solver runs very efficiently on multi-core machines. From a future-EDA perspective, the entire body of CAD software will need to migrate onto these new multi-core machines because they'll be everywhere. Going forward, for instance, Intel is going to ship multi-core machines, so migrating commercial CAD software in an efficient way is going to be very important for the EDA vendors and the users. The EDA companies are recognizing that very soon everyone will want to migrate their tools, so
 there's a lot of gain to be had. The work in our lab is indicating that by doing the proper migration and using better algorithms we can achieve significant speedup."</P>
<P>"Microsoft is also making a big effort in this area, looking at parallel compilers. The idea is that the programmer will be able to write sequential code and the compiler will translate it into an optimized parallel executable. It's a problem today that many people are looking at, although as yet it's not clear which will be the right way to eventually solve it. One particular approach is to use transactional memory to give the programmer the illusion of writing sequential code, while the software under the hood makes sure it is executed correctly and efficiently in parallel. These are exciting problems with direct applicability to EDA."</P>
<P>"But these are not the only projects we're working on in Pittsburgh. We're also working in the area of machine vision, analyzing skin or MRI images to assist in the diagnosis of malignant tumors. Our tools search a huge database of images to help confirm a diagnosis. It's a type of search engine -- not Google-like -- but a search engine nonetheless, and just one of several projects in robotics and virtual reality that we're working on. All of our projects in the lablet involve topics that are very hot today, topics that are the new horizons for computing" </P>
<P>As enthused as Limor is about her group's work at Pittsburgh, this is not the first time she's been excited about the technology focus of her research. In the years following graduate school, the first phase of her career was spent with Intel in Israel developing Intel&#8217;s formal verification tools.</P>
<P>Limor says, "I earned all of my degrees at Technion in Haifa, a BS, MS, and PhD. My thesis was on formal verification, which at the time was quite theoretical. Model checking was just beginning at the time, and it was only after that technology started to mature that formal verification began transferring from academia into industry."</P>
<P>"Following graduation, I spent two years at Cornell University doing a post-doc. I was then recruited back to Israel by Intel where I lead the formal verification group for 12 years. First we were just a research group, but then our prototype tools became good enough for internal use. The development took a lot of effort, but even more effort was needed to convince the Intel design teams to change their verification methodologies. Integrating the tools into the design flow took several years, but as the designers learned to use the new tools, they began to understand their value and the right way to use them. Eventually, we all learned that we needed to work together closely to discover
 where formal verification fit into the overall flow."</P>
<P>Limor notes that Intel was not alone during those years in working on formal verification. IBM was studying the technology, as well. She says, "Both Intel and IBM published papers about formal verification at the time -- I'm talking about the 1994 timeframe here -- and then the EDA companies joined the effort. Later the EDA companies themselves started offering such tools, but prior to that it was impossible to buy commercial tools." </P>
<P>Things have changed radically today, according to Limor: "Verification technologies are being widely used for many applications -- some for equivalence verification, some for formal verification of assertions, some for microcode verification, and some for low-power design verification. In general today, third-party tools are now good enough that, in some applications, there is no advantage to using internal tools. In fact, some of the EDA offerings in formal verification are excellent."</P>
<P>She adds, "The certification of a formal specification language was also a huge and important effort required to reach this goal. The process involved a great deal of work from Accellera, working with language donations from IBM, Intel, Verisity, and Motorola. The Accellera committee looked at these offerings for several years and eventually helped make PSL the IEEE standard. That work, of course, helped the EDA companies to align their tools and offerings to the same specification language, which in turn expedited the development of even better EDA formal verification tools."</P>
<P>The current success of EDA verification tool vendors, doesn't mean the internal CAD groups aren't still hard at work, however, according to Limor: "With some of the newer applications, we again see the phenomenon that companies like Intel are using tools that the EDA vendors are not providing. You're still seeing technology leadership from the internal CAD groups, because we continue to have better access to feedback from the in-house design teams who use the tools. We are able to discuss their latest challenges with them and find new ways to apply the technology to their current problems. Again, this work eventually will become common knowledge and then the EDA industry will get
 involved."</P>
<P>Which is where DAC plays a vital and ongoing role. Limor says that DAC provides a venue for discussion of the cutting-edge technologies coming out of the universities and the user companies, which in turn drive the evolution of EDA tools. As a long-time employee of a user company, now serving in her 5th year on the DAC Executive Committee, Limor says she understands this process well.</P>
<P>Limor was initially invited to serve on the Technical Program Committee for DAC because of her work at Intel on formal verification. Then she was invited to serve on the Executive Committee -- first as Technical Program Co-Chair for 2 years, and then as Exhibit Liaison Chair for 2 years. Even in her 5th year, she continues to admire the work that goes into the conference and the results that come out.</P>
<P>Per Limor, "The fact is that everyone comes to DAC and everyone contributes to creating a special event. We have enormous contributions from academia --- more than 100 people devoting their time to filtering and selecting the technical papers -- and then there are the committees that help to select the tutorials, the panels, and the special sessions. All of the EDA companies, plus their customers big and small, contribute their expertise in this decision-making process. The end result is something that is quite unique and capable of moving the entire design automation domain forward. DAC is really a meeting place where people from industry express their needs, and where they can give
 talks and participate on panels to fully explain what their current problems are. Academics and EDA professionals benefit greatly from this feedback."</P>
<P>As far as her own responsibilities for DAC 2007 are concerned, Limor says she'll be attending to more specific tasks than just promoting the research agenda of her employer, one of the largest EDA users in the world. She says she'll be focusing on her responsibilities for the strategic development of DAC, but even more importantly, "Ellen Sentovich [DAC 2006 General Chair] and I will be trying to help Steve Levitan [DAC 2007 General Chair] as much as we can. We will try to share the burden with him, just as we know he'll help me next year when I am General Chair at DAC 2008. Ellen, Steve, and I all know that as long as you have strong people around you, even a task as large as putting
 together DAC is doable."</P>
<P>"But even with our responsibilities at DAC," she insists, "Each of us needs to continue to attend to our day jobs. It's only by working in the trenches on a day-by-day basis, developing or using automated tools for electronic design, that we are able to fully understand what it is people need today and tomorrow by way of CAD tools. People who have not been involved in design automation, or are no longer involved, simply cannot see the community from the inside as we see it. It's difficult to hold down that day job and still do an adequate job in assembling the conference, but we know the DAC machine is crucial for moving the entire industry forward. It's a fantastic show and one that
 helps to keep the market on track!"</P>

           The Workshop on Computer Architecture Research Directions

                                   CARD 2007

                          http://www.ele.uri.edu/CARD

********************************************************************************

                       Held in conjunction with HPCA 2007
                               February 11, 2007
                                  Phoenix, AZ 

Introduction:
=============
Decreasing transistor feature sizes simultaneously offer increased opportunities
and challenges for computer architecture researcher and designers. With hundreds
of millions or billions of transistors, computer architects can propose complex
microarchitectural enhancements, increase processor functionality, or implement
multiple processors-per-chip. On the other hand, among other problems, shrinking
transistor widths also lead to increased static power dissipation; higher power
densities, which require active thermal management; and decreased reliability
(due to soft-errors and circuit degradation).

The future directions of such open research problems are unclear. The
traditional way to tackle open research problems is for experts in the field to
write papers and present those papers in conferences. After each presentation,
other experts may ask one or two detailed questions that are often too complex
and assume too much background knowledge for many audience members. After the
session, the experts may assemble to discuss finer points, reach some consensus
and then go off to their respective bases to do the next generation of research
to write the next paper.

While such a model is fine for the experts, it often is not very helpful to an
average audience member. Instead, a direct discussion between experts would be
far more useful. Such a discussion, properly moderated by another expert, could
quickly focus in on what are accepted results and parameters of the subject,
what are the open questions and areas of disagreement of the subject and what
are the most promising approaches to those open problems. Audience questions,
properly filtered by the moderator to ensure relevance, would further guide the
discussion.

Accordingly, the purpose of this workshop is to serve as a forum in which
experts in each field can debate the state of the field and future directions. 
The format is designed to quickly focus on areas of disagreement, rather than
expounding on areas of agreement which, presumably, have ceased to be
controversial, at least between the two panelists.

The hope is that the workshop will be useful to a diverse audience from a
graduate student looking for good thesis topic areas to a senior researcher who
wants to hear the opinions of other area experts.

More specifically, this workshop consists of following four 60 minute
mini-panels:

Description of Panels:
======================
The panels are as follows:

Mini-panel #1: Single-threaded vs. Multi-threaded
    Yale Patt (University of Texas) vs. Mark Hill (University of Wisconsin)
    Moderator: Joel Emer (Intel)

Mini-panel #2: Reliability

Mini-panel #4: Security
    Leendert Van Doorn (IBM) vs. Cetin Kaya Koc (Oregon State University)
    Moderator: Jean-Pierre Seifert (University of Innsbruck)
 
The mini-panels are intended to help clarify the open issues of each topic and 
to discuss those open issues.  The hope is that the workshop will be useful to a
diverse audience from a graduate student looking for good thesis topic areas to
a senior researcher who wants to hear the opinions of other area experts.

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION

Network-on-Chips  (NoCs)  are  emerging  as  a  new  on-chip  communication
paradigm. Diagnostic services, such as test, debug, and on-line monitoring,
are  becoming an  important factor  in designing  next-generation NoC-based
systems. The  NoC infrastructure  itself requires diagnostic  services, and
can  also  be  used  to  support  those for  the  entire  system.  Although
significant research has  been done in NoC design, there  are many open and
pressing issues  regarding diagnostic services. The focus  of this workshop
is to explore them and their implications on system design.

Call for Papers

  STMCS: Second Workshop on Software Tools for Multi-Core Systems
         http://www.isi.edu/~mhall/stmcs07/

         March 11, 20007
         San Jose, CA

  in conjunction with IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code
  Generation and Optimization (CGO)
  http://www.cgo.org/

The drive towards multi-core systems is being led by technology
advances such as increasing chip densities and lower design costs of
replicated functionality as compared to today's increasingly complex
high-end microprocessors.  As multi-core systems are already being
sold and deployed, the goal of this workshop is to provide a forum to
discuss what software tools -- from operating systems and virtual
machines on up to programming models -- must be developed to make
effective use of the computational power of these new architectures.
The format of the workshop will be a half day, with a set of invited
talks, presentations selected from the submissions, and a panel
discussion or posters to complete the schedule.

Topics of interest, including:

* Programming models
* Managing heterogeneity
* Relationship to other parallel computing strategies (embedded and
  high-end)
* Impact on applications
* O/S and Run-time management
* Virtual machines
* Binary translation
* Performance tuning


Important dates:

* Submission deadline (revised!):     January 23, 2007, 11:59PM PDT
* Notification of acceptance:         February 14, 2007
* Final version:                      February 28, 2007

Submission guidelines:

Submissions should be extended abstracts or position papers of 2-4
pages, double-column, in 11-point font.  Include the list of authors
and their affiliations, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, email
addresses and the name of the corresponding author. Please send
submissions by the deadline to: Mary Hall via email at mhall at isi.edu.

                        Held in conjunction with HPCA 2007
                                February 11, 2007
                                   Phoenix, AZ

Introduction:
=============
Decreasing transistor feature sizes simultaneously offer increased  
opportunities
and challenges for computer architecture researcher and designers.  
With hundreds
of millions or billions of transistors, computer architects can  
propose complex
microarchitectural enhancements, increase processor functionality, or  
implement
multiple processors-per-chip. On the other hand, among other  
problems, shrinking
transistor widths also lead to increased static power dissipation;  
higher power
densities, which require active thermal management; and decreased  
reliability
(due to soft-errors and circuit degradation).

The future directions of such open research problems are unclear. The
traditional way to tackle open research problems is for experts in  
the field to
write papers and present those papers in conferences. After each  
presentation,
other experts may ask one or two detailed questions that are often  
too complex
and assume too much background knowledge for many audience members.  
After the
session, the experts may assemble to discuss finer points, reach some  
consensus
and then go off to their respective bases to do the next generation  
of research
to write the next paper.

While such a model is fine for the experts, it often is not very  
helpful to an
average audience member. Instead, a direct discussion between experts  
would be
far more useful. Such a discussion, properly moderated by another  
expert, could
quickly focus in on what are accepted results and parameters of the  
subject,
what are the open questions and areas of disagreement of the subject  
and what
are the most promising approaches to those open problems. Audience  
questions,
properly filtered by the moderator to ensure relevance, would further  
guide the
discussion.

Accordingly, the purpose of this workshop is to serve as a forum in  
which
experts in each field can debate the state of the field and future  
directions.
The format is designed to quickly focus on areas of disagreement,  
rather than
expounding on areas of agreement which, presumably, have ceased to be
controversial, at least between the two panelists.

The hope is that the workshop will be useful to a diverse audience  
from a
graduate student looking for good thesis topic areas to a senior  
researcher who
wants to hear the opinions of other area experts.

More specifically, this workshop consists of following four 60 minute
mini-panels:

Description of Panels:

The Impact of Virtualization on Commercial Workloads
Mendel Rosenblum (Stanford University)

This talk describes how virtualization is changing the way computing is done in the industry today and how it is causing users to rethink how they view hardware, operating systems, and application programs.  The talk will describe this new view on computing and the benefits driving users to adopt it. The changing roles for hardware and operating systems will be discussed along with what changes will be needed to efficiently and simply support this new computing model.

O Java, Java! Wherefore Are Thou Java? (Invited paper)
S. M. Blackburn (Australian National University) and K. S. McKinley (The University of Texas at Austin)

The experimental systems community relies on benchmarks to evaluate proposed innovations in applications, compilers, operating systems, and architecture.  Therefore, the choice of benchmarks and the programming language in which they are written is a gating function for innovation in our field.  While the applications community is increasingly embracing managed languages, such as Java and C\#, due to their software engineering benefits, systems researchers have not. For the most part, systems researchers use C or C++.  To evaluate managed languages, researchers will need new evaluation methodologies. We demonstrate and recommend how to perform meaningful experiments as compared to those in use for C or C++.  Because many applications now and in the future will be in managed languages, it may behoove some systems researchers to eat their own dog food, by building systems in managed languages.

Optimizing Data Mining Workloads using Hardware Accelerators (Invited paper)
A. Choudhary, R. Narayan, B. Ozisikyilmaz, G. Memik (Northwestern University), J. Zambreno (Iowa State University), J. Pisharath (Intel)

Data mining is the process of finding useful and actionable patterns in large data sets. Datamining algorithms have become vital to researchers in science, engineering, medicine, business, search and security domain. In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in both the size of the data being collected that must be analyzed. Processors and systems, on the other hand, have been designed and optimized for simulation, scientific, media, and database workloads. In our previous work in the development of Minebench, a comprehensive data mining benchmark, we have demonstrated that computational characteristics as well as data access requirements for datamining workloads is quite different than those of these other workloads. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the current approaches and challenges faced in system design. Then we present initial designs and results for accelerating data mining algorithms using programmable hardware. Initial results show that tr!
 emendous performance gains can be obtain by accelerating these workloads over using traditional systems.

********************************************************************************

                       Held in conjunction with HPCA 2007
                        Sunday Morning, February 11, 2007
                                  Phoenix, AZ 

Cache designs are increasingly critical to the overall performance of computer systems. The ever-increasing memory wall problem means that a single memory
access which right now costs hundreds of processor cycles will keep increasing. Furthermore, the trend in hardware design in placing multiple processor
cores on a chip, coupled with the trend of increasing software complexity and the number of software layers point to a significant capacity pressure in
caches for years to come. Consequently, understanding the impact of various aspects of cache design is crucial in ensuring good overall system performance.
Unfortunately, current practices for evaluating cache performance rely almost solely on cycle-accurate simulation, which is costly to run and offers
insufficient insights into the relationship between application behavior and cache parameters.

The purpose of this tutorial is to bring together recent advances in analytical and empirical modeling technology for cache performance, and present them to
computer architect designers and researchers, so that they can benefit from the technology. In particular, the tutorial will not only present the models,
but also present how the models can be used in practice for cache design exploration. Some of the tools will be released and their usage and demo will also
be presented.

List of Topics:

Introduction - 5 mins

Capturing temporal locality behavior - 25 mins

- Stack distance profiling

- Circular sequence profiling

Modeling the Impact of Cache Parameters on Performance - 30 mins

- Predicting cache miss rates across different cache sizes and associativities

- Prediction cache miss rates across different replacement policies

Modeling the Impact of Cache Interference in Multi-core and multi-tasked system  - 60 mins

- Predicting the impact of cache sharing in CMP

- Predicting the impact of context switches on cache states

Analysis of the effects of miss clustering on the cost of a cache miss - 60 mins

- Describe new technique to measure the cost of a cache miss.

- Display graphs showing cost of each miss versus cluster size

- Use graphs to analyze prefetching algorithm

- Present theory that describes miss cluster patterns versus cost

The tutorial materials will be based on prior publications (roughly 60%) as well as ongoing research work (roughly 40%). When materials are taken from prior
publications, the emphasis will be beyond technical description of the models, but also on how the models can be used in practice, and on case studies that
show useful insights obtained using the models.

Call For Papers SAMOS VII
(2nd call - SUBMISSION DEADLINE: February 9, 2007)
(paper submission site opens soon)

International Symposium on Systems, Architectures, MOdeling, and
Simulation  (SAMOS VII)
Samos, Greece, July 16-19, 2007

http://ce.et.tudelft.nl/samos/samos_vii/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SAMOS is a premier and well-established symposium on embedded
systems organized annually since 2001. The symposium brings together
researchers from academia and industry on the quiet and inspiring
northern mountainside of the Mediterranean island of Samos. It
provides an environment where collaboration rather than competition
is fostered.

The symposium comprises two co-located events:

* International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems:
  Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation (IC-SAMOS)

  The conference considers new state-of-the-art mature research papers
  on all aspects of embedded processor hardware/software design and
  integration. The IC-SAMOS is an IEEE co-sponsored conference (by both
  the IEEE CAS Society and the IEEE Germany SSCS chapter) and the
  conference proceedings will be published in the IEEE series.

* International Workshop on Systems, Architectures, Modeling, and
  Simulation (SAMOS Workshop)

  The workshop considers state-of-the-art research papers as well as
  papers on ongoing work with promising preliminary results. Positional
  and in-depth review papers are also considered. Furthermore, the
  workshop covers additional topics compared to IC-SAMOS that are
  complementary to processing and necessary to build embedded systems,
  e.g., sensor systems. The workshop proceedings will be published by
  Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.

The IC-SAMOS topics of interest are: (but not limited to)

* Application-specific/Domain-specific Embedded Systems
* Profiling, Measurement and Analysis Techniques for Embedded Systems
* Hardware/Software Co-design
* Design Space Exploration
